<p class='c004'>Giles Inglett Saltren had promised his
mother to say nothing to any one of what had
been told him, but the temptation had come
strongly upon him to tell Arminell that he was
not the nobody she and others supposed, and
he had succumbed in the temptation. He
and the girl had interests in common, sympathies
that drew them together, and he felt
that it would be of extraordinary benefit to
her, and a pleasure to himself, if, in that
great house, where each was so solitary, they
could meet without the barrier which had
hitherto divided them and prevented the
frank interchange of ideas and the communication
of confidences. Later on in the evening,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>it is true, that he felt some twinges of
conscience, but they were easily stilled.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles had greatly felt his loneliness. He
had been without a friend, without even a
companion. He could not associate with
those of his mother’s class, for he was separated
from them by his education, and he
made no friends in the superior class, from
the suspicion with which he regarded its
members. He had made acquaintances at
college, but he could not ask them to stay at
Chillacot when he was at the park, nor invite
them as guests to Orleigh; consequently,
these acquaintanceships died natural deaths.
Nevertheless, that natural craving which exists
in all hearts to have a familiar friend, a
person with whom to associate and open the
soul, was strong in Jingles.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the reader has travelled in a foreign
country—let us say in Bohemia—and is ignorant
of the tongue, Czech, he has felt the irksomeness
of a <i>table d’hôte</i> at which he has sat,
and of which he has partaken, without being
able to join in the general conversation. He
has felt embarrassed, has longed for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>dinner to be over, that he might retire to his
solitary chamber. Yet, when there, he
wearies over his loneliness, and descends
to the coffee-room, there to sip his <i>café noir</i>,
and smoke, and pare his nails, and turn over
a Czech newspaper, make up his accounts,
then sip again, again turn over the paper, re-examine
his nails, and recalculate his expenditure,
in weariful iteration, and long for the
time when he can call for his bill and leave.
But, if some one at an adjoining table says,
“Ach! zu Englitsch!” how he leaps to eager
dialogue, how he takes over his coffee-cup
and cognac to the stranger’s table; how he
longs to hug the barbarian, who professes to
“speaque a littelle Englitsch.” How he
clings to him, forgives him his blunders, opens
a thirsty ear to his jargon, forces on him
champagne and cigars, forgets the clock, his
nails, his notes, the bill and the train, in the
delight of having met one with whom he can
for a moment forget his isolation.</p>

<p class='c005'>If this be so when meeting with a foreigner,
how much more cordial is our encounter with
a pleasant Englishman. We at once seek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>out links of connection, to establish the fact
of our having mutual acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c005'>So did the impulse come on Saltren and
overpower him. There was a community of
ideas between him and Arminell: and he was
swept away by his desire to find a companion,
into forgetfulness of the promise he had made
to his mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>That he was doing wrong in telling the
girl a secret, about which he had no right to
let a hint fall without her father’s knowledge
and consent could hardly be hid from his
conscience, but he refused to listen, and
excused himself on grounds satisfactory to his
vanity. It was good for Arminell herself to
know the relationship, that she might be able
to lean on him without reserve. Giles Inglett
Saltren had been very solitary in Orleigh.
He had not, indeed, been debarred the use
of his mother-tongue; but he had been unable
to give utterance to his thoughts; and
of what profit is the gift of speech to a man,
if he may not speak out what is on his mind?
The young are possessed with eager desire
to turn themselves inside out, and to show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>every one their internal organisation. A
polypus has the same peculiarity. It becomes
weary of exposing one surface to the tide,
and so frankly and capriciously inverts itself,
so that what was coat of stomach becomes
external tissue, and the outer skin accommodates
itself to the exercise of digestive
functions. Young people do the same, and
do it publicly, in society, in a drawing-room,
in unsympathetic company. As we grow
older we acquire reserve, and gradually withdraw
our contents within ourselves, and
never dream of allowing any other surface to
become exposed to the general eye, but that
furnished us by nature as our proper external
envelope.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young tutor had his own crude, indigested
notions, a mind in ferment, and an
inflamed and irritable internal tissue, and he
naturally and eagerly embraced the only
opportunity he had of inverting himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, again, a still mightier temptation
operated on Jingles, the temptation which
besets every man to assume the rôle of somebody,
who has been condemned to play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the part of nobody, when an opening is
given.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a poem in Percy’s Reliques, that
represents the grievances of the common
Englishman at the time of the Reformation,
who dislikes the change that is going on
about him, the introduction of novelties, the
greed that masqueraded under the name of
religion: and every verse ends with the
burden, “But I am little John Nobody, and
durst not speak.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles had been unable to express his
opinion, to appear to have any opinion at all;
he had been in the house, at table, everywhere,
a little John Nobody who durst not
speak. Now the <i>rôle</i> of little John Nobody
is a <i>rôle</i> distasteful to every one, especially
to one who has a good opinion of himself.
Imagine the emotions of an actor who has
been doomed for years to be a walking
gentleman, to whom has been suddenly
offered the part of Hamlet. Would he not
embrace the chance with avidity?</p>

<p class='c005'>When Arminell approached Jingles with a
not exactly, “Me speaque a littelle Englitsch!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>but with the confession that she understood
his mind, and was asking of life the same
questions that troubled him, then he warmed
to her and longed for a closer intercourse.
When, moreover, he found that it was possible
for him to establish a tie of a close and
binding nature between them, it was more
than his moral courage could resist to break
the seal of silence and tell her who he was.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Jingles had entered into no particulars,
and Arminell could not rest with the half-knowledge
she possessed. She could not
ask him to tell her more, nor could he explain
the circumstances. She could not
endure to be kept in partial ignorance, and
immediately after breakfast, on the following
morning, she went to Chillacot to see Mrs.
Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>The captain’s wife was greatly alarmed
when she heard what was wanted. Arminell
spoke coldly, distantly, haughtily. Mr. Giles
Inglett Saltren, she said, had let drop some
words that implied a relationship. She must
know whether there were any foundations
for the implication. Mrs. Saltren trembled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>and made excuses, and attempted evasions;
but Arminell was determined to know the
facts, and she forced the woman to repeat to
her the story she had told on the previous
night.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, oh, miss! I named no names;
and Giles never ought to have breathed a
word about it. I will go down on my knees
to you to beg you to say nothing to any one
about this matter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you suppose it is a subject I am
likely to discuss—to Mrs. Cribbage, for instance?
That I will talk freely of an affair
which compromises the honour of my
father?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There is scarce any one knows about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Except my father, yourself, and your
son.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And the captain; but, miss, I beg you to
bear witness that I named no names.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want to know no more, none of the
details,” said Arminell, “I only trust they
may all be rolled up and cast away into
oblivion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She returned to the park, went into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>music-room and began to practise on the
piano. She was able to do the mechanical
work and think at the same time. She believed
the story she had been told, not so
much because Marianne Saltren had related
it, as because Jingles so confidently believed
it. He would never have spoken to her on
the matter had he harboured the slightest
shadow of doubt.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the story was one on which her mind
must busy itself. She began unconsciously
to play Agatha’s song “Leise, leise,” from
“Der Freischütz,” and as she played, two
tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had always regarded her father with
respect as a man of principle and strict
notions of honour, though she did not consider
him as a man of ability. Now he
appeared to her in a light that showed him
guilty of conduct unworthy of a gentleman,
inexpressibly base and cowardly. His behaviour
towards her own mother had been
bad, for Arminell was satisfied that her
mother would never have married Lord
Lamerton had she been allowed to suspect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>that his character was stained with such an
ugly blur.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad she died,” said the girl with a
sob, and then with a start she asked, “How
was it that that woman was in the house with
my mother? How could she bear it? No;
my dearest mother knew nothing, had no
suspicions, and it was generous of Mrs.
Saltren to be so near, and never let her
suspect what had been done to her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She shook her head to shake out the conjectures
that distressed her. It was a pity
she did put these questions from her. Had
she looked at them more closely she would
have seen the incoherence in the story told
her by Marianne. Then the same thought
occurred to her which had presented itself to
Jingles. Was it not possible that the marriage
with the servant-maid had been a valid
one, but that advantage had been taken of
her ignorance to make her believe it was not,
and so for Lord Lamerton to shake himself
free from an encumbrance which had become
irksome to him? but if this were the case,
her own mother’s marriage would be of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>questionable legality, and with it would go
her own—Arminell’s—legitimacy. A cold
terror came over the girl at the thought.
By all means Jingles must be induced to
desist from investigating the matter and
pressing his rights, if he had any. What a
condition of affairs would ensue if the marriage
of Marianne were a real one. Why
the present Lady Lamerton would not be a
proper wife, nor little Giles legitimate any
more than herself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was young, had no practical
knowledge of the world, and her imagination
had been fed by novels, not of the most
wholesome quality. Such an incident, such
a hideous entanglement involving so many
was quite in accordance with romance, and
the young are always expecting reality to
take romantic lines, as the old are always
mistrusting the romantic, as the garb of
falsehood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell leaned her elbow on the music-stand,
and her head in her palm. She felt
faint and sick at the thought that had risen
up in her.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>At that precise moment Giles Inglett
Saltren came into the room. He had heard
the sound of the piano, and he knew that the
girl spent an hour every morning in the
music-room practising. She looked up,
recovered her distracted thoughts, and resumed
her mechanical play on the keys.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you want to speak to me?” she
asked, as he took his place beside the grand
piano, ready to turn over the leaves of her
exercises.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; what are you playing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am practising, not playing anything of
importance, anything consecutive, a reverie;
but one must hack every day, without it all
execution goes out of the fingers. It is a
pity that hacking with the tongue so many
hours a day does not conduce to brilliancy of
conversation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should like a few words with you,” said
the tutor, “if you can spare me the time. I
wish to express my regret for having spoken
last night. I ought not to have revealed the
secret of my birth; but it was burning in my
heart, and flamed out at my mouth.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Arminell continued playing and said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must let the matter drop,” he said in
a low tone, “I will not presume again, if you
will endeavour to forget.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How can I forget? As well dash vitriol
in my eyes, and say don’t allow them to
smart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He saw that there were tears on her
face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sincerely sorry,” he said, “I am
heartily penitent. I see I have hurt you.
My words were vitriol, and your eyes have
overflowed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Doubly do you hurt me now—in noticing
what should have been left unobserved. I
am crying over my dead respect for my
father. I loved him in my own queer and
wayward fashion, though there was little we
had in common. I believed him to be upright
and good, and now my faith is gone to
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must make allowances,” said Jingles.
“This happened long ago—I am twenty-one—and
Lord Lamerton was at the time young,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>under thirty. In token of his regret he has
done much for me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been accustomed,” said Arminell,
“to look up to my father, and I have been
full of a certain family pride—not pride in
rank and wealth and all that sort of thing,
but pride in the honour and integrity which I
believed had been ours always; and now I
find—” she sobbed; she could not finish her
sentence.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am very sorry. I shall ever reproach
myself,” was the impotent remark of Jingles,
but he did feel a sting of self-reproach. He
had acted cruelly to kill a girl’s trust in her
father.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It cannot be helped,” she said, “it is
done. Well, I know all, my eyes are opened,
I accept you as my half-brother. When my
father married again he sacrificed half his
fatherhood in me, or so I felt it; and now
of that half that remained something has been
taken from me. Very little of my dear papa
remains now—only a shadow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I,” said Jingles, “I am even in a
worse plight than you, for I can not love a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>father who has so wronged my mother.”
After a long pause, during which he held and
fluttered a page of Arminell’s music, he
added, “What a forlorn condition mine is.
I am here by sufferance who ought to be here
by right. Every one dins in my ears the
great kindness which I have had shown me
by his lordship, and yet I know that I am
not receiving more than a fraction of the
portion that should be mine. Her ladyship
patronises me, Giles regards me as a hired
tutor, the servants are barely civil, the guests
either ignore me or cast gibes, as—” he
checked himself; he was again recurring to
the half-shaved French poodle, when in at
the door, or French window that led from
the terrace, came Lord Lamerton, fresh and
cheery.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Saltren,” he said, “you here! I am
glad of that. The man I want; do me a
favour, my good fellow, and be the go-between
’twixt your father and me. Arminell,
have you seen Giles this morning? He is
better, dear rascal, and quite bright. What,
doing drill on the keys? Saltren, I hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>you will do your utmost endeavour with your
father about his house. The company are in
a quandary about it. We—I am a director,
you know—we will give him a tip-top
price, in fact, more than twice its value.
The place is really not a pleasant one, and
well deserves its chilly name. ’Pon my word
I believe it was the cold and damp situation
that sowed in you the seeds of pulmonary
disease. I sent Macduff down, but he could
effect nothing. I believe, on my very soul,
that there is no man on earth but yourself
who can move your father. He is a stubborn
man, eh, Saltren? I would go myself and
see him about it, but Macduff tells me your
father is ruffled about the manganese. It is
the deuce of a pity, but I cannot help myself.
I wish he could be persuaded to sell. Why,
Saltren, between you, me and the piano, I
believe if I chose to dispute your father’s
right to Chillacot I could beat him. Macduff
says that there has been some sort of
acknowledgment made every year, there was
no lease of any sort, and I am the lord of the
manor—but I won’t do that. I won’t be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>harsh or seem so, not only because I have
the utmost respect for the captain, such a
good and thoroughly upright man, but above
all, because he is your father, my boy.
However, my dear Saltren, something must
be done, we are in a fix. The company will
be put to the greatest possible inconvenience
and much expense that might be avoided, if
it has to carry the line below. Your
father—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seven,” muttered Jingles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon?” asked my lord,
raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing, my lord,” answered the young
man. “I had no intention to interrupt. I
was counting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Counting—oh, whilst my daughter played.
She has given over strumming, so give over
counting, please. You will do what I ask,
will you not?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will see him, my lord, as it is your
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Use all your powers of persuasion. Tell
him that I want to cut a new road, to find
employment for the men; and if the station
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>be at Chillacot, the road must go there. If
your father—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Eight,” whispered Jingles as an aside,
and looked at Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If your father is reasonable, we will
begin at once. You see how we are situated.
I can understand his reluctance to quit a
house where he was born, and for which he
has done so much; but then, consider the
price offered for it. This offer comes in most
fitly now that the mine is abandoned. Your
father—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again the tutor looked at Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your father must leave, as there is no
work for him of the kind he is accustomed
to, and a nice little capital would be very
serviceable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will go, my lord, at once,” said Jingles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you, Saltren, thank you. I have
to be off to catch the 11.28 train.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He went out of the room through the
window by which he had entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you hear?” asked the tutor, partly
in scorn, partly in pain. “Nine times at
the least did he speak of the manganese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>captain as my father, although he knew perfectly
all the while that I am not his son. Did
you notice the pointed way in which he
spoke? It was as though he suspected that
I had got wind of the truth, and would emphatically
let me understand that he would
never, never acknowledge it, emphatically
bid me consider the mining captain as my
father. But”—his face darkened with anger—“I
am by no means assured that we
know the whole truth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell shuddered. Jingles looked intently
at her, and saw that she divined his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said he calmly: “never fear that I
will have the story published to the world.
It would bring disgrace on too many persons.
It would make my mother’s position now as
the wife of Captain Saltren an equivocal one.
To disclose the truth, whatever complexion
the truth might be found to wear when
examined, would cause incalculable misery.
What I shall do, whither I shall turn, I
cannot yet tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell also had noticed the manner in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>which Lord Lamerton had spoken of the
captain to the tutor as his father, and she
also, with her preconceptions, thought it was
pointedly so done.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said Jingles. “I shall have to
leave this house, and I shall let his lordship
know that I am not as blind as he would wish
me to be. But what I shall do is as yet
undetermined. I shall ask you to help me to
come to a decision.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XX.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>HE BECOMES SOMEBODY.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Arminell kept to herself that day. At lunch
she had not much to say to her step-mother,
and Lord Lamerton was out. Giles came
down, and his mother talked to him and to
the tutor, and seemed not to observe Arminell’s
silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The girl was unhappy. She had given
way to a momentary weakness, or wave of
regret at the thought of her father’s unworthiness,
but the feeling predominating in
her mind was indignation that her mother
should have been left unacquainted with the
previous conduct of my lord. She repeated
to herself, “Most certainly she never knew
it, or she would never have married him,
even if she knew that ceremony was worthless
that had been performed over him and
Marianne.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had idealised her mother. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>girl had an affectionate heart, but she concentrated
her affection on the memory of her
mother. Ever since her father’s re-marriage
there had brooded over her a sense of wrong
done to the memory of the mother. How
could my lord, after having loved such a
woman, take to himself his present wife?</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was by no means easy in mind
about Jingles’ assurance that he would not
speak. He had given the same assurance
as Mrs. Saltren had told her, to his mother,
and had broken his promise. She resolved
to exert her powers of persuasion on him to
deepen this determination to be silent.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was unfortunate that Lord Lamerton
had not been able to cultivate more freely his
daughter’s society, but a nobleman has ten
thousand calls on his time; he is prevented
from living that close life of familiar association
with his children which is the privilege of
those in an inferior station. He considered,
and he was right in considering, that his
country, his order, and his county had claims
on him which must not be put aside. He
was a poor orator indeed, and rarely spoke in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the House, but he conscientiously voted with
his party. In town he and Lady Lamerton
saw a good deal of society, not because they
cared particularly for it, but because they
considered it a duty to entertain and keep up
relations with friends and connexions. In
the country Lord Lamerton, as Arminell
contemptuously said, was kept on the gallop
between school prize-givings, petty sessional
meetings, quarter session, political and charitable
institutions. He sat on boards, occupied
chairs wherever there were boards and
chairs placed for him. Moreover, at Orleigh,
after the London season, the house was full
of acquaintances, who came to shoot, hunt,
drive, and be amused; and, with a house full
of guests, Lord Lamerton had not opportunity
for cultivating the society of his
daughter. But he was a man full of kindness,
and he made many attempts to gain
her affection, and persuade her to be to him
the close companion that a daughter often
is to a father. These attempts had failed,
chiefly because of the resentment she bore
him for having married again. Had he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>remained a widower, and sought to associate
her with him in his pursuits, it might have
been otherwise; but, as he had looked elsewhere
for a companion, she closed her heart
in reserve against him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton was fond of hunting, and
in this Arminell did not accord with him.
Her Girton governess had scoffed at those
who had nothing better to do or think of than
the pursuit, over hedge and gate, of a creature
hardly bigger than a cat; and the sneer had
taken effect on the girl, and made her regard
her father, because of his hunting, as somewhat
grotesque and deficient in moral dignity.
She could not accompany him when shooting,
but she was out of sympathy with sport of
this kind also. Her governess had spoken
of those lords of creation who concentrated
their vast intellects on the killing of a jack-snipe,
and this remark stuck in her, as did
the other about fox-hunting. She regarded
sportsmen as fools, more or less. I once
knew a man who had a mole with three
white hairs growing out of it, on his nose;
and, when I talked with him, one hemisphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of my brain was engaged in considering the
mole, and asking how it came there—whether
it had grown as he grew, or whether it had
been of the same size when he was born, and
whether his body had expanded and elongated
about it; why he did not disguise it with
chalk or violet powder, or else darken the
three white hairs with antimony; whether he
had consulted a surgeon concerning its removal,
and, if so, why the surgeon had not
removed it? Was it the cork plugging an
artery, so that the man would bleed to death
were it to be cut away? Why he, of all men,
was afflicted with this mole—was it hereditary?
And if so, on which side did it come
to him, on the paternal or maternal? And if
it were a hereditary mole, whether it would
be possible, by judicious crossing, to reduce
and finally extirpate it? Then again, whether
after long disappearance, in say three generations,
the mole would declare itself in the
fourth? what the mole had to do with the
doctrine of evolution? whether the Anthropological
Society had considered this mole?
and other questions. Afterwards I did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>know whether this man had blonde hair or
swarthy, eyes brown or blue, an intellectual
forehead or one retreating, nose acquiline,
<i>rétroussé</i>, or sausage. Neither could I recall
anything about his conversation—I could
think of him only as the Man with the mole,
or, to be more exact, as the Mole with the
man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, it sometimes happens that we see a
blemish in a man’s character, and that blemish
entirely engrosses our attention, so that we
cannot conceive of the man other than as the
man with the blemish. He may have good,
counterbalancing qualities, but of these we
know nothing, we take no account, we see
only the moral mole.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, this habit of seeing moles, and
marking nothing but moles grows on us. I
quite remember how that for a twelvemonth
after I had talked with my gentleman with
the mole, I examined the nose of every one
I met, exploring it for moles, and expecting
to find them hid under disguises, powdered
or patched over; or to discover traces of the
amputation of moles, suspicious, tell-tale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>scars, or else tokens that latent moles were
on the eve of eruption, moles that had been
hidden deep in the system, which were unsuspected
by nearest and dearest, gradually,
stealthily, inexorably working into publicity;
and I began to calculate how long it would
be before the suspected mole came to light.
And I became radically convinced that all
men had moles in their constitution—that is,
all men but myself—and that all men therefore
were to be mistrusted, and held at arms’
length, lest their moles should communicate
themselves to us, after the manner of warts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had not indeed reached this
stage, but she was in that condition in which
she saw the faults of her father and step-mother,
and the faults only. Unable to forgive
him his second marriage, she was predisposed
to judge unfairly and harshly all he
did, and all he left undone.</p>

<p class='c005'>That one special reason for his re-marriage
was his desire to provide her with
a step-mother, one who could guide and
advise her, and counteract some of the mischief
done by injudicious governesses, never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>for a moment occurred to her, and yet this
had been the predominant motive in the
mind of Lord Lamerton when he chose
Lady Julia Chesterton. She was a woman
spoken of as clever and well-read, and kind-hearted.
Clever, well-read, and kind-hearted
he had found her, and yet deficient in
the very quality necessary for commanding
Arminell’s respect, and that was decision.
Lady Julia, whatever Arminell might
think, was an able woman, but her promiscuous
reading had sapped the foundations of all
independence of mind that she ever possessed,
and had acted on her brain, as acids
on osseous matter—reducing it to jelly. She
was ever building with head, and hands, and
heart, an indefatigable builder, but always on
no foundations at all, because she argued
that solid rock was no where discoverable,
and sand was liable to shift, therefore she
would erect her structures in the air, on
nothing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had been disappointed at
the result, but had no idea as to the cause of
failure. And now, upon a mind in antagonism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>this disclosure made by Mrs. Saltren
came, and brought Arminell’s antagonism to
a climax.</p>

<p class='c005'>The tears which young Saltren had surprised
were the sole tribute of her filial affection.
When they were dried only hostility
remained.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some while ago, Messrs. Pears published
an advertisement of their soap, on which
were a green spot and another red, and the
curious were invited to study one spot at a
time, and then look at a blank wall. When
this was done, he who had contemplated the
red spot, saw a green disc dance before his
eyes; but if, on the other hand, he had
looked long on the green spot, he saw before
him only a red ball. It is so with a good
many people; and it was so with Arminell.
Whenever Lord or Lady Lamerton wished
her to see this or that, to take such a view
of some particular matter, she invariably saw
the complimentary colour, that is the reverse
of what she was desired to see.</p>

<p class='c005'>I, who write this, am ashamed to confess
that I do the same, and I am not sure that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>occasionally, you, my dear reader, may also
do the same—now and then, of course, only
when the wind is easterly, and the liver is
out of order, or the next morning after a
ball. I know that when I have read the
<i>Saturday Review</i>, I rise from the perusal
believing in Mr. Gladstone and ready to
follow him to the bottom of the Red Sea, or
wherever else he desires to lead us; and
that when I have read the <i>Pall-Mall
Gazette</i>, I am eager to drive my wife and
daughters into the Primrose League. Also,
I am quite sure that when some person has
been warmly lauded in your hearing, dear
reader, you take a low view of that individual,
and when another has been much
disparaged, you take up the cudgels to
defend him, though he or she is an absolute
stranger to you, and one of whom you have
never heard before. I never recommend a
watering-place to my friend, sure, if he goes
there, he will call it a beastly hole, or dissuade
him from buying a horse, by detailing
its faults, so certain am I that my words will
make him purchase the brute.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>In the afternoon of the same day, as the
sun was warm, and the air was soft, Saltren
took little Giles upon the terrace, and Arminell,
who saw them from her window,
descended, and joined them there. She was
uneasy and impatient to know what the
tutor intended doing. Would he come to a
full understanding with Lord Lamerton, and
would my lord agree to provide for him, if
he would depart and keep the secret of his
birth undisclosed? Or would Jingles in
London discover sufficient to make him
suspect that his mother’s marriage was valid,
and be carried away by ambition to establish
his legitimacy at all costs to others?</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same moment that Arminell came
out on the terrace, the rector’s wife, Mrs.
Cribbage, drove up in her wickerwork pony-carriage,
and entered the house to pay a
visit to Lady Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles ran off to see his rabbits, and Jingles
was left alone walking with Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose you are not burdening Giles
with many lessons, now that he is convalescent?”
said the girl.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“No, her ladyship does not wish him to be
pressed. He is still heavy in his head with
cold.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Arminell, “I did not come
here to talk about Giles, so we will dismiss
him from our conversation. I have been
considering this miserable matter, and I want
to know what action you purpose taking on
it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I also,” said the tutor, “have been revolving
the matter in my head, and I have
resolved to leave Orleigh as soon as possible,
and to ask my uncle, Mr. James Welsh, my
mother’s brother, to assist me to enter a
literary career.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Literary career! in what branch?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I intend to write for the press, I mean for
the papers. Mr. Welsh lives by his profession,
and I will do the same.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That must be more interesting than teaching
little boys Mensa—mensæ, Dominus—domini.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The press is the sceptre that now rules
the world, and I will wield it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, how I envy you!” said Arminell.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“You are about to do something, something
worth the labour, something the thought of
which kindles ambition. You will escape out
of this wearisome round of hum-drum into the
world of heroic action. Here is my lord
spending his life in petty duties as he regards
them and has no result at the end to show;
my lady thinking, planning, executing, and
also with no result appearing; and I, wasting
my time practising at the piano, running my
voice over scales, doing a little sketching,
reading odds and ends, picking flowers—and
nothing can come of it all. We are made for
more serious work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I believe,” said Jingles, “that the writer
of leaders exercises more power, because he
appeals to a wider circle, than even the member
of Parliament. One out of every twenty
who takes up a paper, reads the speeches, but
every one reads the leading articles. I believe
that we stand at the beginning of a great
social revolution, not in England only, but
throughout the civilized world, and I have
long desired to take part in it, I mean in
directing it. I do not hold the extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>opinions of some, but I have my opinions,
no, that is not the word, convictions, bred in
me by my perception of the inequalities, injustices,
and unrealities of life as it is now
organised.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you will work for your uncle?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not altogether hold with him,” said
Jingles. “He takes too commercial an aspect
of the mission imposed on a man with his
power and faculties for reaching the ear of the
people.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you intend to live with him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot tell. I have decided on nothing
as to the particulars. I have sketched out
the broad features of my future career.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,”—Arminell’s voice faltered—“my
father?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will write to him after I am in town,
informing him that I know all, and that, therefore,
it was not possible for me, with self-respect,
to remain in his house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell looked down on the gravel.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will not go into this matter, not
have my mother’s name brought in question?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“I will do nothing that can cause you a
moment’s pain,” answered Jingles patronisingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I shall be very solitary,” she said. “More
so than before. With you I can talk about
matters of real interest, matters above the
twaddle of common talk—Yes?”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was addressed to the footman who
appeared on the terrace and approached.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Matthews?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lady says, miss, that she will be glad
if you could make it convenient to step into
the parlour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There,” said Arminell, when Matthews
had withdrawn. “So she stands between me
and the light at all times. I shall be back
directly. She wants me about the choice of
some new patterns for covering the sofas and
chairs, I dare say. Here comes Giles from
his rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell walked slowly to the drawing-room,
with a frown of vexation on her brow.
She never responded with alacrity to her step-mother’s
calls.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Cribbage, the rector’s wife, saw at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>once that Arminell was in a bad humour, as
she entered the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am so sorry to interrupt you,” she said.
“It was my doing. Lady Lamerton and I
were speaking about old Samuel Ceely, and I
have just heard how you have interested
yourself about him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sent to ask you to come, dear,” said
Lady Lamerton in her sweet, gentle tones,
“because Mrs. Cribbage has been telling me
about the man. He is unobjectionable now,
but he was a bit of a rake once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was a gamekeeper to the late Lord
Lamerton, and to the dowager,” put in Mrs.
Cribbage, “and was dismissed. I could find
out all the particulars. I believe he sold the
game, and besides, was esteemed not to have
the best moral character. However, I know
no particulars. I will now make a duty of
enquiring, and finding them out. Of late
years—except for snaring rabbits and laying
night-lines—I believe he has been inoffensive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are all miserable sinners,” said
Arminell, “we were told so on Sunday——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“You were not at church on Sunday,” interrupted
Mrs. Cribbage.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,” continued Arminell, “it is really
satisfactory to know that poor Ceely is not an
exception to that all-embracing rule, and that
he has not the moral perfection which would
make up for his physical short-comings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell could not endure the rector’s
wife, and took no pains to disguise her feelings.
Lady Lamerton likewise disliked her,
but was too sweet and ladylike to show it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Cribbage was an indefatigable parish
visitor. She worked the parish with the
most conscientious ardour, considering a
week lost unless she had visited every house
in it and had dispensed a few pious scriptural
remarks, and picked up a pinch of gossip in
each. She knew everything about every one
in the place, and retailed what she knew, especially
if it were too unpleasant to retain.
She did not give out much scandal in the
cottages, but she pecked here and there after
grains of information, and swallowed what
she found. And the people, well aware of
her liking, with that courtesy and readiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to oblige which characterises the English
lower orders, brought out and strewed before
her all the nasty, and ill-natured, and suspicious
scraps of information they had hoarded
in their houses. Mrs. Cribbage carried away
whatever she learned, and communicated it
to her acquaintances in a circle superior to
that where she gathered it, to the Macduffs,
to the wives of the neighbouring parsons, to
the curate, with caution to Lady Lamerton.
She acted as a turbine wheel that forces
water up from a low level to houses on a
height. She thus impelled a current of tittle-tattle
from the deep places of society to those
who lived above; but in this particular she
differed from the turbine, that forces up clean
water, whereas, what Mrs. Cribbage pumped
up was usually the reverse.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Cribbage was nettled by Arminell’s
uncourteous tone, and said: “What charming
weather we have been having. I hope,
Miss Inglett, that you enjoyed your Sunday
morning walk?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was as delightful as the weather,” answered
Arminell, well aware that there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>claws in the velvet paw that stroked her.
“Would you wish to know where I
went?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, my dear Miss Inglett! I know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Mrs. Cribbage left, and when she
was gone, Lady Lamerton said gently, “You
were too curt with that woman, dear. You
should never forget your manners, never be
rude to a visitor in your own house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not an adept at concealment, as are
others.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The best screen against such a person is
politeness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is like a snail, with eyes that she
stretches forth to all parts of the parish. I
hate her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell, your father has been putting
prickly wire about on fences where cattle or
pigs force their way. The beasts scratch
themselves against the spikes, and after one
or two experiences, learn to keep within
bounds, and lose the desire to transgress.
The Mrs. Cribbages—and there are yards of
them—are the spiky wires of society, hedging
us about, and keeping us in our proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>places, odious in themselves, but useful, and
a protection to us against ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Barbed or unbarbed, I would break
through them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, my dear, you would only tear yourself
to pieces on them, without hurting them;
they are galvanised, plated, incapable of feeling,
but they can inflict, and it is their
mission to inflict an incredible amount of
pain. You have already committed an indiscretion,
and the crooked spike of the
Cribbage tongue has caught you. Instead
of going to church on Sunday morning, you
walked in the road with Mr. Saltren. Of
course, this was an act of mere thoughtlessness,
but so is the first plunge of the calf
against the prickly wire. Be more judicious,
dear Armie, in the future. Where were you
on Sunday afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sitting with Giles and Mr. Saltren,” said
Arminell, furious with anger and resentment,
“talking Sabbath talk. We discussed
Noah’s ark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And this morning he went into the
music-room to you. Your father told me he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>found him there turning over the leaves of
your music, and counting time for you; and
now Mrs. Cribbage arrives and sees you
walking with him on the terrace. My dear
Armie, Jingles is a nobody, and these nobodies
are just those whom it is unsafe to
trifle with. They so speedily lose their
balance, and presume.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mr. Saltren is not such a nobody as you
suppose,” answered Arminell. “He is a
man of ability and independence of thought,
he is one who will before long prove himself
to be a somebody, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, he is a somebody already who
has established himself as a nuisance.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXI.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>So, now, even this was denied Arminell, to
talk with a rational man, the only rational
man in the house, about the subjects that
interested her. She must keep Mrs.
Cribbage before her eyes, ever walk in daily
fear of Mrs. Cribbage; consider, before she
did anything she liked, what would Mrs.
Cribbage’s construction on it be. The
opinion of Mrs. Cribbage was to be what
she must strive to conciliate. All principle
must be subordinated to the judgment of
Mrs. Cribbage, all independence sacrificed to
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is one of those pleasant delusions under
which we live in England, that we have
only God and the Queen to look up to and
obey. As a matter of fact Mrs. Cribbage is
absolute in heaven and earth, and the Divine
law has no force, unless subscribed by Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Cribbage. We fear God, because Mrs.
Cribbage is His vicegerent, and has the
triple crown and power of the keys, and in
addition bears the sword. Resistance is
powerless before the all-reaching power of
Mrs. Cribbage. The Holy Vehm was
nothing in its might to the judgment of Mrs.
Cribbage. Her ministers are everywhere
executing her orders, and none of the condemned
dare to remonstrate, or attempt
escape. We may utter with impunity treasonable
words against the Queen, and profess
agnosticism towards God, but no one disputes
the existence of Mrs. Cribbage and
would not lick the dust under her feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>No one loves this autocrat, but there is
not a Nihilist in her realm.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton had likened her to American
barbed wire, and those who have dealings
with Mrs. Cribbage touch her as I have
seen porters handle a roll of spiked wire
deposited on the railway platform, with
caution, and impatience to consign it to its
proper destination. And yet, though every
one dreads, and some positively loathe Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Cribbage, yet all agree that it would not be
possible to live without her. She keeps
society together as a paperweight compacts
all kinds of scraps of correspondence, and
bills and notices.</p>

<p class='c005'>As long as young girls are in the nursery,
and subject to governesses, they look forward
to their coming out as to a time of
emancipation. They have not reckoned on
Mrs. Cribbage, who, as with a whoop they
burst out of the school-room, confronts them
and blocks their road.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had done with her schooling, and
properly ought to have come out that year,
but the event had been postponed, as Lord
Lamerton did not wish to go to town that
year. She was free from governesses, and
by no means inclined to lay her neck under
the wheels of Mrs. Cribbage’s car. When
my lord and my lady had gone to town during
the season, Arminell and Giles had not
attended them. Giles was better in health in
the country, with his pony, and his cricket,
that is, with the tutor bowling to him, and
the coachman’s son acting as long-stop;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>accordingly, he was left at Orleigh to his
great delight, and Arminell was left as well,
with the governess, to continue her lessons,
till she put off governesses and other childish
things. Arminell had not therefore been
brought much in contact with the world, and
did not know the force of public opinion, she
no more considered it than she considered
the pressure of the atmosphere. According
to our best authorities, we are subjected to
the weight of fifteen pounds to each square-inch
of surface, and a man of ordinary size
sustains a pressure on him of some thirty-thousand
pounds of air. I am a man of
ordinary size, but I no more knew that I
laboured under the burden of thirty-thousand
pounds than I did that I was subjected to the
pressure of about the same burden of Mrs.
Cribbage who sits on my shoulders all day
and squats on my chest all night, till I turned
up the matter in an encyclopædia. We no
more think about the pressure of public
opinion, I say, than we do about the pressure
of the atmosphere. We make allowance for
it, in all we undertake.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>If we ascend great heights we suffer because
we are no longer subjected to the
pressure; our noses bleed, our breath comes
short; and if, by any chance, we get out of
the region where public opinion weighs, we
become alarmed, uneasy, gasp, and cry out
to be brought back under its incubus once
more.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Arminell had left the room, and
closed the door behind her, she stood for a
minute, resting the fingers of her left hand on
the lock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Should she obey her step-mother or defy
her? She had promised young Saltren to
return to the terrace. She wanted to have
further talk with him. Why should she submit
to the dictation of Lady Lamerton who
was influenced by the hints of that detestable
Mrs. Cribbage? If Lady Lamerton were
allowed her own way in small matters, she
would presume to dictate in those which
were large, and Arminell would be allowed
no will of her own. In her heart, the girl
admitted that her step-mother had reason to
reproach her. If Jingles were only the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>tutor, and the son of the mining captain, he
was, as my lady said, a nobody, and it was
unbecoming for her to frequent his society.
Indeed, it was hardly decorous for her to be so
much with him, were he any thing else but
what she knew him to be, her brother. The
possession of the knowledge of their relationship
altered the aspect of her conduct radically,
and justified it. Lady Lamerton, in
her ignorance, interfered, and might be excused
interfering, but she, Arminell, being
better informed, was at liberty to act differently
from what my lady advised. The
young man was her brother, and what more
delightful intercourse than that which subsists
between brother and sister, when like-minded?
There had taken place no open
rupture between her ladyship and Arminell
as yet; but it was inevitable that one would
come, and that shortly; perhaps, the girl
argued, the sooner the better, that her step-mother
might be made clearly to understand
that she—Arminell, stood on her independence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The girl let go the handle of the drawing-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>door, and with beating heart and
heaving bosom, went deliberately out on the
terrace and resumed her place at the side of
Jingles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come,” she said, “as I undertook.
My lady has read me a lecture.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About barbed wire, about Mrs. Cribbage.
That creature saw me walking with you, and
remonstrated with mamma, I mean my step-mother,
and my lady retailed the remonstrance,
as in duty bound; I am forsooth to
be placed under Mrs. Cribbage, to have my
feet strapped, compressed and distorted, like
those of a Chinese lady, till I am unable to
walk alone, and must lean on the shoulders
of the Cribbage and my lady. This sort of
thing is intolerable to me. Oh, that I were
a man, that I might run away, as you are
going to do, and stamp, and stride, and dance,
and use every muscle in my feet freely. I
detest this strapping and pinching and crippling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have felt the same,” said the young
man. “And it has become unendurable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>me. One must either submit or break away.
The process must end in irremediable distortion,
and fatal deprivation of the power of
walking independently. Your whole future,
your character for good or evil, depends on
your conduct now. If you fall back in your
chair unable to resist——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I will kick and kick, I will not be
disabled from walking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you make a brief attempt to resist, and
do not maintain a stubborn and determined resistance,
you will be cramped and crippled
for life. As you put it, the whole social
system of the upper classes is Chinese bandaging
of the feet; not only so, but it is Indian
flattening of the skull. I have felt, and so
have you, that in this house our heads are
strapped between boards to give them the requisite
shape, and our brains to be not
allowed to exceed the requisite measure.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What can I do? I have no one but
yourself to advise me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will be impossible for you to escape
the influences brought to bear on you, if you
remain here; the Cribbages, great and small,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>will lie in wait till you are napping and then
fall on you and bind you, and apply the laces
to your feet, and the boards to your head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, whither could I go?” Arminell
asked. She thought for a moment, and then
said, “If I went to my Aunt Hermione, it
would be going from beneath the shower under
the shoot. There never was a more formal,
society-laced creature in the whole world than
my aunt, Lady Hermione Flathead. Everything
in her house, her talk, her manners,
her mind, her piety, everything about her is
conventional.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton approached, with little
spots of colour in her cheeks, holding a
parasol.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Arminell,” she said, “how can
you be so inconsiderate as to come out without
a sunshade?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see,” said Arminell, turning contemptuously
away and addressing the tutor;
“everything is to order. I may not even
take two steps without a parasol, in fine
weather; and in bad, without an umbrella.
The hand must never be free.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“I think, Mr. Saltren,” said Lady Lamerton,
“that it would be well if Giles went
indoors, and, now that he is better, learnt a
little Latin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As your ladyship desires it, certainly,”
answered the tutor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am so glad, my dear,” said Lady
Lamerton, “that you have waited for me on
the terrace. I am sorry to have detained
you one minute, but I was looking out the
address of those Straceys. I will take your
arm and we will look at the pansies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Step-mothers, the Germans call them,”
said Arminell. “I do not admire pansies.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We call them pansies, from <i>pensée</i>, dear,
which means thought, kind thought, and forethought,
which possibly, though not always
acknowledged, is to be found in step-mothers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell tossed her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The homely name for these same
flowers,” continued Lady Lamerton, “is
hearts-ease, and I’m sure it is a misnomer, if
hearts-ease be the equivalent for step-mother,
especially when she has to do with a wayward
step-daughter.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“I think that step-mothers would find
most hearts-ease, if they would turn their
activity away from their step-daughters, and
leave them alone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My conscience will not suffer me to do
this,” answered Lady Lamerton without
losing her temper. “You may not acknowledge
my authority, and you may hold
cheap my intellectual powers and acquirements,
but, after all, Armie, I <i>am</i> in authority,
and I do not think I am quite a
fool. I can, and I must, warn you against
dashing yourself against the barbed wire.
My dear, if we would listen to others, we
would save ourselves many a tear and bitter
experience. I love you too well, and your
dear father too well, to leave you uncautioned
when I see you doing what is foolish
and dangerous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But do you not know that experience is
the one thing that must be bought, and cannot
be accepted as a gift?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon. Our whole system
of social culture is built upon experience
accepted and not bought. It is not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Catholics alone who hold by tradition, we all
do it, or are barbarians. Progress without it
is impracticable. We start from the accumulated
experience of the past, handed on
to us by the traditions of our fathers. If
everyone began by rejecting the acquisitions
of the past, advance would be limited to the
term of man’s natural life, for everyone
would begin from the beginning; whereas,
each generation now starts where the last
generation left off. It is like the hill of
Hissarlik where there are cities superposed
the one on the other, and each is an advance
culturally and artistically on that below—above
the Greek Ilium, below the Homeric
Troy, under that the primeval hovel of the
flint-chipper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Each on the ruins of the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Each using up the material of the other,
following the acquisitions of the earlier
builders and pushing further on to structural
perfection.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That may be true of material process,”
said Arminell, “but, morally, it is not true.
Besides, our forefathers made blunders. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>have been speaking with Mr. Saltren about
the Flatheads and the Chinese who compress
the heads and double up the feet of children.
But our ancestors were nearly as stupid.
Look at the monument of the first Lord
Lamerton in the church. See the swaddled
babies represented on it, cross-gartered like
Malvolio. Now we give freedom to our
babies, let them stretch, and scramble, and
sprawl. But you old ladies still treat us
young girls as your great-grandmothers
treated their babies. You swaddle us, and
keep us swaddled all our life long. No
wonder we resent it. The babies got emancipated,
and so will we. I have heard both
papa and you say that when you were children
you were not allowed to draw nearer
the fire than the margin of the rug. Was
there sense in that? Was the fire lighted to
radiate its heat over an area circumscribed
by the mat, and that the little prim mortals
with blue noses and frosty fingers must
shiver beyond the range of its warmth?
We do not see it. We will step across the rug,
and if we are cold, step inside the fender.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“And set fire to your skirts?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We will go for warmth where it is to be
found, and not keep aloof from it because of
the vain traditions of the elders.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton sighed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear,” she said, “we will not
argue the matter. To shift the subject, I
hardly think it was showing much good
feeling in you to come straight out here after
I had expressed my wish that you would
not. It was not what I may term—pretty.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had promised Mr. Saltren to return to
him and resume the thread of our interrupted
conversation. Why did you send for me
about old Ceely’s past history, as if I cared a
straw for that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I sent for you, Armie, because you were
walking with the tutor, and Mrs. Cribbage
had observed it. She told me, also, that
you had been seen with him when you
ought to have been at church.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was injudicious. She also said that
you had been observed walking in the
avenue last night with a gentleman; but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>was able to assure her that the gentleman
was your father.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This espionage is insufferable,” interrupted
Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I allow it is unpleasant, but we must be
careful to give no occasion for ill-natured
remark.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can not. I will not be swaddled and
have my feet crippled, and my head compressed,
and then like a Chinese lady ask to
be helped about by you and Mrs. Cribbage.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Better that than by any one you may
pick up.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not ask to be helped about by
any one I may pick up. Besides, Mr.
Saltren was not picked up by me, but by my
father. He introduced him to the house,
gave him to be the guide and companion of
Giles, and therefore I cannot see why I may
not cultivate his acquaintance, and, if I see
fit, lean on him. I will not be swaddled,
and passed about from arm to arm—baby
eternal!”</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>TOO LATE.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Lady Lamerton said no more to Arminell,
but waited till the return of his lordship,
before dinner, and spoke to him on the
matter.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was aware that any further exertion
of authority would lead to no good. She
was a kind woman who laboured to be on
excellent terms with everybody and who had
disciplined herself to the perpetual bearing of
olive branches. She had done her utmost
to gain Arminell’s goodwill, but had gone
the wrong way to work. She had made
concession after concession, and this made
her step-daughter regard her as wanting in
spirit, and the grey foliage of Lady Lamerton’s
olive boughs had become weariful in
the eyes of the girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>If my lady had taken a firm course from
the first and had held consistently to it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Arminell might have disliked her, but would
not have despised her. It does not succeed
to buy off barbarians. Moreover, Arminell
misconstrued her step-mother’s motives.
She thought that my lady’s peace pledges
were sham, that she endeavoured to beguile
her into confidence, in order that she might
establish a despotic authority over her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not know what to do with Armie!”
sighed Lady Lamerton. “We have had a
passage of arms to-day and she has shaken
her glove in my face. Another word from
me, and she would have thrown it at my
feet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She said no more, as she was afraid of saying
too much, and she waited for her husband to
speak. But, as he offered no remark, but
looked annoyed, she continued, “I am sorry
to speak to you. I know that I am in fault.
I ought to have won her heart and with it
her cheerful respect, but I have not. It is
now too late for me to alter my conduct.
Arminell was a girl of sense when I came
here, and it really seems disgraceful that at
my age I should have been unable to win the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>child, or master her. But I have failed, and
I acknowledge the failure frankly, without
knowing what to suggest as a remedy to the
mischief done. I accept all the blame you
may be inclined to lay on me—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton went up to his wife, took
her face between his hands and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Little woman, I lay no blame on you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, dear, then I do on myself. I told
you last night how I accounted for it. One
can look back and see one’s faults, but looking
forward one is still in ignorance what
road to pursue. It really seems to me, Lamerton,
that on life’s way all the direction
posts are painted so as to show us where we
have diverged from the right way and not
whither we are to go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Julia, I exercise as little control over
Armie as yourself. It is a painful confession
for a father to make, that he has not won the
respect of his child—of his daughter, I mean;
as for Giles—dear monkey—” his voice
softened and had a slight shake in it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I am sure,” said Lady Lamerton,
putting her arms round his neck, and drawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>his fresh red cheek to her lips, “that there is
nothing, nothing whatever in you to make
her lack the proper regard.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will tell you what it is,” said Lord
Lamerton, “Armie is young and believes in
heroes. We are both of us too ordinary in
our ways, in our ideas, in our submission to
the social laws, in our arm-in-arm plod along
the road of duty, to satisfy her. She wants
some one with great ideas to guide her; with
high-flown sentiment; to such an one alone
will she look up. She is young, this will
wear off, and she will sober down and come
to regard hum-drum life with respect.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In the meantime much folly may be perpetrated,”
said Lady Lamerton sadly. “Do
look how much has been spent in the restoration
of Orleigh. You have undone all that
your grandfather had done. He overlaid
the stone with stucco, and knocked out the
mullions of the windows for the insertion of
sashes, and painted over drab all the oak
that was not cut away. So are we in later
years restoring the mistakes made in ourselves,
perhaps by our parents in our bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>up, but certainly, also, by our own folly
and bad taste in youth. And well for us if
there is still solid stone to be cleared of
plaster, and rich old oak to be cleared of the
paint that obscures it. What I dread is lest
the iconoclastic spirit should be so strong in
the girl that she may hack and tear down in
her violent passion for change what can
never be recovered and re-erected.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is not without principle.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She mistakes her caprices for principles.
Her own will is the ruling motive of all her
actions, she has no external canon to which
she regulates her actions and submits her
will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What caprice has she got now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She has taken a violent fancy to the
society of young Saltren.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh! he is harmless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not so certain of that. He is
morbid and discontented.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Discontented! About what? Faith—he
must be hard to please then. Everything
has been done for him that could be done.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Possibly for that reason he is discontented.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Some men like to make their own fortunes,
not to have them made for them. You have,
in my opinion, done too much for the young
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was consumptive and would certainly
have died, had I not sent him abroad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—but after that?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then he was unfit for manual labour,
and he was an intelligent lad, refined, and
delicate still. So I had him educated.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you sure he is grateful for what you
have done for him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton shrugged his shoulders. “I
never gave a thought to that. I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am not sure that he is. Look at children,
they accept as their due everything
given them, all care shown them, and pay no
regard to the sacrifices made for them. There
is no conscious gratitude in children. I
should not be surprised if it were the same
with young Saltren. I do not altogether
trust him. There is a something in him I do
not like. He does his duty by Giles. He
is respectful to you and me—and yet—I have
no confidence in him.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Julia,” said Lord Lamerton with a laugh.
“I know what it is, you mistrust him because
he is not a gentleman by birth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all,” answered his wife, warmly.
“Though I grant that there is a better guarantee
for a man of birth conducting himself
properly in a place of trust, because he has
deposited such stakes. Even if he have not
principle in himself, he will not act as if he had
none, for fear of losing caste. Whereas one
with no connections about him to hold him in
check will only act aright if he have principle.
But we have gone from our topic, which was,
not Jingles, but Arminell. I want to speak
about her, and about him only so far as he
influences her for good or bad. I will tell
you my cause of uneasiness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she related to her husband what she
knew about the Sunday walk in the morning,
and the Sunday talk in the afternoon,
and the music-room meeting on the following
morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” said his lordship, “he only went
there to turn over the pages of her music.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You see nothing in that?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“’Pon my soul, no.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I must tell you about her conduct
this afternoon, when she disobeyed me in a
marked, and—I am sorry to use the expression—offensive
manner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That I will not tolerate. I can not suffer
her to be insolent to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“For pity’s sake do not interfere. You
will make matters worse. She will hate me
for having informed you of what occurred.
No—take some other course.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What course?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will it not be well to get rid of Saltren?
And till he has departed, let Arminell go to
Lady Hermione Woodhead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Within parenthesis be it said that Woodhead
was Aunt Hermione’s real name, only
in scorn, and to signify her contraction of
mind, had Arminell called her Flathead, after
the tribe of Indians which affects the compression
of infants’ skulls.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot dismiss him at a moment’s
notice, like a servant who has misconducted
himself. I’ll be bound it is not his fault—it
is Armie’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Let Arminell go to her aunt’s at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By all means. I’ll have a talk with
Saltren.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not a word about Arminell to him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course not, Julia. Now, my dear, it
is time for me to dress for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Dinner passed with restraint on all sides.
Lord Lamerton was uncomfortable because
he felt he must speak to Arminell, and must
give his <i>congé</i> to the tutor. Arminell was in
an irritable frame of mind, suspecting that
something was brewing, and Lady Lamerton
was uneasy because she saw that her husband
was disturbed in his usually placid manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>After dinner, Lord Lamerton said to his
daughter as she was leaving the room, “Armie,
dear, are you going into the avenue? If so,
I shall be glad of your company, as I intend
to go there with a cigar presently.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you wish it, papa; but—Mrs. Cribbage
heard that you and I had been walking there
last night, and it meets with her disapproval.
May James first run to the rectory with our
compliments and ask Mrs. Cribbage’s kind
permission?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>She looked, as she spoke, at her step-mother,
and there was defiance in her eye.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense, dear,” said her father. “I
shall be out there in ten minutes. Will you
have a whitewash, Saltren, and then I will
leave for my cigar? You are not much of a
wine-drinker. I am glad, however, you are
not a teetotaller like your father.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again a reference to the captain. Jingles
looked towards the door, and caught Arminell’s
eye as she went through. She also
had heard the reference, and understood it,
as did the tutor. Certainly his lordship was
very determined to have the past buried, and
to refuse all paternity in the young fellow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well,” said the girl to herself, “I
will let my father understand that I know
more than he supposes. He has no right to
shelve his responsibilities. If a man has
done wrong, let him be manful, and bear the
consequences. I would do so. I would be
ashamed not to do so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She set her teeth, and her step was firm.
She threw a light shawl over her head and
shoulders and went into the avenue, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>she paced with a rebellious, beating heart a
few minutes alone, till her father joined
her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know, papa, what you want; or rather
what you have been driven to. My lady
has been peaching of me, and has constituted
you her executioner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell, I dislike this tone. You
forget that courtesy which is due to a father.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Exacted of a father,” corrected the girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And due to him as a father,” said Lord
Lamerton, gravely. His cigar was out. He
struck a fusee and lighted it again. His
hand was not steady, Arminell looked in his
face, illumined by the fusee, and her heart
relented. That was a good, kind face, a
guileless face, very honest, and she could see
by the flare of the match that it was troubled.
But her perverse mood gained the upper
hand again in a moment. She possessed
the feminine instinct in dealing with men,
when threatened, to attack, not wait to be
attacked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not think it fair, papa, that my lady
should hide herself behind you, and thrust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>you forward, as besiegers attack a fortress,
from behind a screen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are utterly mistaken, Arminell, if
you imagine that your mother—your step-mother—has
intentions of attacking you.
Her heart overflows with kindness towards
you, the warmest kindness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa, when Vesuvius is in eruption, the
villagers in proximity pray to heaven to
divert into the sea, anywhere but towards
them, the warm gush of incandescent
lava.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell,” said her father, “you pain me
inexpressibly. I suppose that it is inevitable
that a daughter by a first wife should not
agree thoroughly with her father’s second
choice; but, ’pon my soul, I can see no
occasion for you to take up arms against your
step-mother, she has been too forbearing
with you. She is the kindest, most considerate
and conscientious of women.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You may spare me the enumeration of
her good qualities, papa; I am sure she is a
paragon in your eyes, and I would not disturb
the happy conviction. I suppose marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>is much like the transfusion of blood
practised by the rénaissance physicians. An
injection of rabbit’s blood into the arm of a
turbulent man made him sensible to fear, and
one of lion’s blood into the arteries of a
coward infused heroism into his soul. When
there was an interchange of blood between
two individuals they came to think alike, feel
alike, and act alike; it is a happy condition.
But as there has been no infusion of my
lady’s blood into me—I think and feel and
act quite differently from her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We will leave her out of the question,”
said Lord Lamerton, dropping his daughters
arm which at first he had taken affectionately.
“Confound it, my cigar is out again, the
tobacco must be bad. I will not trouble to
relight it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By all means let us leave my lady out of
the question,” said Arminell. “I suppose I
am not to be court-martialed for having discussed
Noah’s Ark on Sunday with the tutor.
I assure you we did not question the universality
of the Flood, we talked only of the
packing of the animals in the Ark.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Was there any necessity for Mr. Saltren
to come to you in the music-room?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No necessity whatever. He came for
the pleasure of talking to me, not even to
turn over my music leaves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must not forget, my dear, who he is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not, I assure you, papa, it is precisely
<i>that</i> which makes me take such an
interest in him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, my dear, I am glad of that; but
you must not allow him to forget what is due
to you. It will not do for you to encourage
him. He is only a mining captain’s son.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa,” said Arminell, slowly and emphatically,
“I know very well whose son he
is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course you do; all I say is, do not
forget it. He is a nice fellow, has plenty of
brains, and knows his place.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, papa,” said Arminell, “he knows
his place, and he knows how equivocal that
place is. He is regarded as one thing, and
he <i>is</i> another.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I daresay I made a mistake in bringing
him here so near to his father.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“So very near to his father, and yet so
separated from him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose so,” said Lord Lamerton,
“education does separate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It separates so widely that those who are
divided by it hardly regard each other as
belonging to the same human family.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I daresay it is so; the miners cannot
judge me fairly about the manganese, because
we stand on different educational
levels.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is not only those beneath the line who
misjudge those above; it is sometimes the
superiors who misunderstand those below.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very possibly; but, my dear, that lower
class, with limited culture and narrow views,
is nowadays the dominating class. It is, in
fact, the privileged class, it pays no taxes,
and yet elects our rulers; our class is politically
swamped, we exist upon sufferance.
Formerly the castle dominated the cottage,
but now the cottages command the castle.
We, the educated, and wealthy are maintained
as parochial cows, to furnish the parishioners
with milk, and when we run dry are cut up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to be eaten, and our bones treated with
sulphuric acid and given to the earth to dress
it for mangel-wurzel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was vexed at the crafty way in
which, according to her view, her father
shifted ground, when she approached too
nearly the delicate secret. She wondered
whether she had spoken plainly enough to
let him understand how much she knew. It
was not her desire to come to plain words,
she would spare him that humiliation. It
would be quite enough, it would answer her
purpose fully to let him understand that she
knew the real facts as to the relationship in
which she stood to the tutor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Papa,” said Arminell, “Giles Inglett
Saltren strikes me as standing towards us
much in the same relation as do those
apocryphal books the names of which my
lady was teaching the children on Sunday.
He is not canonical, of questionable origin, and
to be passed over.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand you, Armie.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sorry, papa, that I do not see my
way to express my meaning unenigmatically.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Armie, I have been talking to mamma
about your paying a visit to Aunt Hermione.
You really ought to see the Academy this
year, and, as mamma and I do not intend to
go to town, it will be an opportunity for you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aunt Hermione!”—Arminell stood still.
“I don’t want to go to her. Why should I
go? I do not like her, and she detests me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, I wish it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What? That I should see the Academy?
I can take a day ticket, run up, race
through Burlington House, and come home
the same evening.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, my dear, I wish you to stay a couple
of months at least, with Hermione.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see—you want to put me off, out of
the way of the tutor, so as to have no more
talk, no more confidences with him. That
is my lady’s scheme. It is too late, papa, do
you understand me? It is too late.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What I say. This is locking the door
after the horse is stolen. Send me away! It
will not alter matters one scrap. As I said
before, the precautions have come too late.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXIII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>“FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.”</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Suddenly, in the midst of his breakfast,
Lord Lamerton uttered an exclamation and
turned purple, and thrust his chair from the
table.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton sprang from her seat.
Arminell was alarmed. She had not seen
her father in this condition before; was he
threatened with apoplexy?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look at it! God bless my soul!”
gasped his lordship. “What confounded
scoundrel has written it? Look at it, Julia,
it is monstrous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He thrust a newspaper from him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is in this damned Radical daily.
Look at it, Julia! Where is Macduff! I
want Macduff. I’ll send for my solicitor.
Confound their impudence, and the lies—the
lies!” Lord Lamerton gasped for breath,
then he went on again, “From our Own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Correspondent—who is he? If I knew I
would have him dragged through the horse-pond;
the grooms and keepers would do it—delighted
to do it—if I stood consequences.
Here am I held up as a monster of injustice,
to the scorn, the abhorrence of all right-minded
men, because I have capriciously
closed the manganese mine. There is a
harrowing picture drawn of a hundred householders
thrown out of work—and thrown out
of work, it is suggested, because at the last
election they voted Liberal; I am depopulating
Auburn—I am in a degree breaking up
families. Not a word about the mine threatening
my foundations—not a hint that I have
lost a thousand pounds a year by it these five
years. I am driving the trade out of the
country; and, as if that were not enough,
here is a sketch of the sort of house in which
I pig my tenants—Patience Kite’s tumble-down
hovel at the old lime-quarry! As if I
were responsible for that, when she has it on
lives, and we want to turn her out and repair
it, and she won’t go. When we have condemned
the house, and gone as far as the law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>will allow us! Where is Macduff? I must
see Macduff about this; and then”—his
lordship nearly strangled, his throat swelled
and he was obliged to loose his cravat—“and
then there is a picture drawn in the liveliest
colours of Saltren’s house—I beg your
pardon, Saltren, this must cause you as much
annoyance as it does myself—of Chillacot, in
beautiful order, as it is; Captain Saltren
does right by whatever he has the care of—of
Chillacot as an instance of a free holding,
of a holding not under one of those leviathans,
the great landlords of England. Look
at this, then look at that—look at Patience
Kite’s ruin and Captain Saltren’s villa; there
you have in a nutshell the difference between
free land and land in bonds, under one of the
ogres, the earth-eaters. God bless my soul,
it is monstrous; and it will all be believed,
and I shall walk about pointed at as a tyrant,
an enemy of the people, a disgrace to my
country and my class. I don’t care whether
she kicks and curses, I will take the law into
my hands and at once have Mrs. Kite turned
out, and her cottage pulled down or put in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>order. I suppose I dare not pull it down, or
the papers will be down on me again. I will
not have a cottage on my land described as
this has been, and the blame laid on me; the
woman shall give up her lease. How came
the fellow to see the cottage? He describes
it accurately; it is true that the door has
tumbled in; it is true that the chimney
threatens to fall; it is true that the staircase
is all to pieces, but this is no fault of mine.
He has talked to Mrs. Kite, but I am sure
she never used the words he has put into her
mouth. Where is Macduff? I wish, my
dear Saltren, you would find him and send
him to me. By-the-way, have you spoken
to your father about—what was it? Oh,
yes, the sale of his house. Fortunate it is
that a railway company, and not I, want
Chillacot, or I should be represented as the
rich man demanding the ewe lamb, as coveting
Naboth’s vineyard, by this prophet of
the press. Who the deuce is he? He must
have been here and must know something of
the place, there is just so much of truth
mixed up with the misrepresentations as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>make the case look an honest one. I want
Macduff. Have you seen your father about
that matter of Chillacot, Saltren?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord,” said Jingles, “I am sorry I
have not seen him yet. In fact, to tell the
truth, I—I yesterday forgot the commission.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” said Lord Lamerton, now hot and
irritable, “oh, don’t trouble yourself any more
about it. I’ll send Matthews after Macduff.
I’ll go down to Chillacot myself. Confound
this correspondent. His impudence is amazing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton took most matters easily.
The enigmatical words of his daughter, the
preceding evening, in the avenue, had not
made much impression on him. They were,
he said, part of her rodomontade. But he
repeated them to his wife, and to her they
had a graver significance than he attributed
to them. This article in the paper, however,
agitated him deeply, and he was very angry,
more angry than any one had seen him for
several years; and the last explosion was
caused by the poisoning of some of his fox-hounds.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Matthews, send James down after Mr.
Macduff at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, Saltren, a word with you in the
smoking room if you can spare me the time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am at your service, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had been so excited by the
article he had read that he was in a humour
to find fault; and, as Viola says</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Like the haggard check at every feather</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That comes before his eye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Such moods did not last long; he was the
slowest of men to be roused, and when angry,
the most placable; but an injustice angered
him, and he had been unjustly treated in the
article in that morning’s paper.</p>

<p class='c005'>There must be deep in our souls, some
original sense of justice, for there is nothing
so maddens a man and sweeps him in angry
fever beyond the control of reason, as a sense
of injustice done, not only to himself, but to
another. It is the violation of this ineradicable
sense of justice which provokes to the
commission of the grossest injustice, for it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>blinds the eyes to all extenuations and qualifying
circumstances. It is an expansive
and explosive gas that lies latent in every
breast—in the most pure and crystalline, an
infinite blessing to the world, but often infinitely
mischievous. It is the moral dynamite
in our composition.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a hot well in Iceland called Strokr
which bubbles and steams far below the surface,
the most innocuous, apparently, of hot
springs, and one that is even beneficial. But
if a clod of turf be thrown down the gullet,
Strokr holds his breath for a moment and is
then resolved into a raging geyser, a volcano
of scalding steam and water. I once let a
flannel-shirt down by a fishing-line, thinking to
wash it in the cauldron of Strokr, and Strokr
resented the insult, and blew my shirt to threads,
so that I never recovered of it—no, not a button.
It is so with men, they are all Strokrs, with
a fund of warmth in their hearts, and they
grumble and fume, but, for all that, exhale
much heat, and nourish flowers about them
and pasture for sheep and asses, but some
slight wad of turf, or a dirty flannel-shirt—some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>trifling wrong done their sense of justice,—and
they become raging geysers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton was not so completely
transformed as that, because culture imposes
control on a man, but he was bubbling and
squirting. He was not angry with the tutor,
personally, because he did not think that the
young man was blameworthy. What indiscretion
had been committed, had been committed
by Arminell. With her he was angry,
because her tone towards him, and her behaviour
to her step-mother, were defiant.
“Saltren,” said he, when he reached the
smoking-room and was alone with Jingles,
“do you think your uncle could have written
that abominable article? I did not mention
my suspicion in the breakfast-room, so as not
to give you pain, or trouble the ladies, but,
’pon my soul, I do not see who else could
have done it. I heard he had been down here
on Sunday, and I hoped he had talked the
matter of the line and Chillacot over with
your father, and had given him sensible
advice. Yet I can hardly think he would do
such an ungracious, under the circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>such an immoral thing as write this, not merely
with <i>suppressio veri</i>, which is in itself <i>suggestio
falsi</i>, but with the lies broadly and frankly
put. Upon my word—I know Welsh is a
Radical—I do not see who else could have
done it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am afraid he has, though I cannot say.
I did not see him, my lord,” said the tutor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sorry, really it is too bad, after all
that has been done—no, I will say nothing
about that. Confound it all, it is too bad.
And what can I do? If I write a correction,
will it be inserted? If inserted, will it not
serve for a leader in which all I have admitted
is exaggerated and distorted, and I
am made to be doubly in the wrong? And
now, I suppose it is high time for Giles to go
to school. I don’t want you to suppose that
this idea of mine has risen in any way from
this damned article, or has anything whatever
to do with it, because it has not. I do
not for one instant attribute to you any part
in it. I know that it shocks you as it shocks
me; that you see how wrong it is, as I do.
But, nevertheless, Giles must go to school;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>his mother and I have talked it over, and
between you and me, I don’t want the boy—dear
monkey that he is—to be over-coddled
at home. His mother is very fond of him,
and gets alarmed if the least thing is the
matter with him, and fidgets and frets, and,
in a word, the boy may get spoiled by his
mother. A lad must learn to hold his own
among others, to measure himself beside
others, and, above all, to give way where it
is courteous, as well as right to give way.
A boy must learn that others have to be
considered as well as himself, and there is
no place like school for teaching a fellow
that. So Giles must go to school. Poor
little creature, I wonder how he will like it?
Cry at first, and then make up his mind to
bear it. I do trust if he have his bad
dreams, the other chaps won’t bolster and
lick him for squalling out at night and rousing
them. Poor monkey! I hope they
will make allowance for him. He is not
very strong. Giles must go to school, and
not be coddled here. His mother is absurdly
fond of the little fellow. I don’t want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to hurry you—Saltren, and you can always
rely on me as ready to do my best for you,
but I think you ought to look about you, at
your leisure, you know, but still look about
you. And, damn that article, don’t you
have anything to do with Welsh, he will
lead you, heaven alone knows whither.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord,” said Saltren, “you forestall
me. I myself was about to ask leave to
depart. I have not the natural qualifications
for a tutor; I lack, perhaps, the necessary
patience. I intend to embrace the literary
profession. Indeed, I may almost say that
I have secured a situation which will make
me independent. Secured is, possibly, too
decided a word—I have applied for one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad to hear it, I am very glad. My
lady said she thought you had a fancy for
something else. But—don’t have anything
to do with Welsh. He will carry you along
the wrong course, along one where I could
do nothing for you, and, I will always help
you when I can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord, whenever you can, with convenience,
spare me——”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Spare you! Oh don’t let us stand in
your way. You have almost got a berth to
get into?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have applied for a place which I may
almost say I can calculate on having. My
only difficulty has been, that I did not know
when I should be at liberty. If your lordship
would kindly allow me to leave immediately——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear fellow, suit your own convenience.
We can manage with Giles.
The rector will give him an hour or two of
Latin and Greek, till the term begins, when
he can go to school. I don’t know that I
won’t let the monkey run wild till the time
comes for the tasks to begin.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, my lord, it is understood that I
may go immediately?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Though Lord Lamerton gave his consent,
he was a little surprised at the readiness of
the tutor to leave Orleigh, and to throw up his
situation before he had really secured another.
There was something ungracious in
his conduct after all the kindnesses he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>received which jarred on his lordship’s feelings.
He had a real liking for the young
man, and he was desirous that he should do
well for himself. He was unable to resist
the temptation to say—“You seem in a vast
hurry to leave us, Saltren.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have reasons, my lord. Something
has occurred which makes it imperative on
me to leave this house immediately.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you refer to this article by our own
correspondent?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all, my lord. It has no connection
with that. Something, a distressing
secret, has come to my knowledge, which
forces me to quit Orleigh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What the deuce is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will probably write to you, my lord,
about it when I am away.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a secret then, between you and me,
and—any one else?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a secret that concerns me most
closely, and indeed, others beside me. But,
no doubt, your lordship has divined to what I
allude.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton turned hot and cold. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Arminell’s mysterious words recurred to his
memory. What had her meaning been?
Was the tutor referring to the same matter?
Had that headstrong girl thrown herself into
his arms, protesting that she loved him?
Very likely. She was capable of doing such
a thing. What else could she have meant?
What else could induce the young man to go
precipitately?</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton hesitated a moment what
to say, looking down, and knitting his brows.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have, my lord, I can see, guessed to
what I refer. It is not a matter on which
we can speak together. It would be too
painful. Each of us would rather say nothing
on a very distressing matter. Let what has
passed suffice for the present. I am sure, my
lord, that you can understand my motives in
desiring to leave promptly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Pon my soul, I think I do. Dash it, I
do!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, my lord, you will not desire to retain
me in Orleigh any longer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—for God’s sake, go. I respect you.
You are behaving aright. I am sorry, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>ashamed, but there, there, you are acting
properly. I will not say another word. Go
where you like, and always look to me as
your friend, nay, as taking almost a fatherly
interest in you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He held out his hand, caught that of young
Saltren and pressed it, then left the room for
his wife’s boudoir.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Julia,” said he, in an agitated tone,
“things are worse than we imagined. I
thought nothing of it, but you women have
eyes where men are blind.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Armie—good heavens!—Armie has
offered herself to young Saltren, and he, like
a gentleman, like a true, honourable gentleman,
has asked me to let him go, because he
cannot remain here any longer, under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did he tell you this?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not in so many words, but there was no
mistaking his meaning. Of course he felt a
delicacy—he did not like to say how—but,
there, there! I shall be angry again. Ah,
that girl! Armie is well off, has her mother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>fortune; he knows that, but was not to be
dazzled. He sees what is right to be done,
and does it. Hah! There comes Macduff.
I see him in the drive. I’ll have the masons
at once, this morning, and tear down Patience
Kite’s cottage.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXIV.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A HANDLE TO THE ENEMY.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When Lord Lamerton decided that a thing
was to be done, he liked to have it done at
once, and now that he was thoroughly roused,
he would brook no delay in the matter of
Patience Kite’s cottage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Kite had baffled the authorities.
There was no question that her house was
unfit to be inhabited by a human being, and
that her life was not safe in it. A heavy
gale might bring the roof and chimney down
on her in her bed and bury her. The relieving
officer had complained and remonstrated.
The sanitary officer had viewed the
ruin and had condemned it. Mr. Macduff
had ordered Mrs. Kite to put the cottage in
repair. She did nothing, and apparently
nothing could be done with her. She absolutely
refused to leave her cottage, and to
put it in habitable condition was beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>her power. If this case had occurred anywhere
in Europe except in England, the
police would have made short work with
Mrs. Kite, but in England, every man’s
house is his castle, in whatever condition the
house may be. Now, had a drain from Mrs.
Kite’s hovel proved a nuisance to neighbours,
she could have been dealt with, but she had
no drains at all; and her roof threatened no
one but herself. The authorities had necessarily
consumed much time over Mrs. Kite,
and all to no purpose. The sanitary officer
complained to the board of guardians a month
after viewing and condemning the house.
The guardians waited another month and
then waited on the magistrates in petty
sessions to issue an order to Mrs. Kite to
vacate her cottage. The order was issued
and served. Another month passed, and
Mrs. Kite had not budged. At the next
petty sessions enquiry was made whether
any further steps could be taken. It appeared
that Mrs. Kite was liable to a fine of
ten shillings for every day she remained after
the order had been served, but, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>sergeant of police observed to the magistrates,
all her goods, if sold, would not fetch ten
shillings, and the clerk of the court could find
no precedent for evicting the old woman; all
that could be done would be to sell her
goods, but that was the limit of their power.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was, it was true, by her tenure, bound
to keep the house in good order, and accordingly
Lord Lamerton, as lord of the manor,
demanded this, but she did nothing. It was
true that he might, in the event of a tenant
neglecting to fulfil the stipulation, order the
repair, and distrain on the tenant for the
costs. But Mrs. Kite was not worth distraining,
and the house was not worth
rebuilding. No one, after the old woman’s
death, would care to live in such a lonely
spot. To rebuild, would cost a hundred and
fifty or two hundred pounds. However,
rather than that the scandal should continue,
Lord Lamerton resolved to rebuild, when he
learned that legally he might not pull down
without rebuilding. So Mrs. Kite was about
to put his lordship to the cost of nearly two
hundred pounds to save her life in her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>despite. We have odd ways of doing things
in England.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The news that Mrs. Kite’s house was to
be pulled about her ears rapidly spread
through the village, and many people assembled
to see the ejection of the hag and
the demolition of roof and chimney.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Kite was a personage not a little
dreaded; she was what is called a wise-woman;
she was consulted when any of the
cottagers were ill. The medical man was
sent for reluctantly, and little trust was put
in his medicines, but the wise-woman enjoyed
the fullest confidence. To meddle
with her was a dangerous matter. She used
her powers for good, but it was quite possible
for her to employ them otherwise. No
one cared to provoke her. Every one
desired to stand on good terms with her.
Before the rector and Mrs. Cribbage, and
my lady and the Macduffs, the villagers
spoke disparagingly of Patience Kite, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>among themselves they regarded her with
respect.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some ill would come of this action of Lord
Lamerton, they argued; he might be a great
man, but there are things with which the
greatest cannot cope. Ill would come of it;
how, no one could say, but somehow, all
agreed, it would come. Had not Patience’s
uncle beaten her when she was a child, and
his house had been burnt down? True,
folks said that Patience had fired it, and true
it was she had been sent to prison on that
account; but it was said she had done it only
because they could not otherwise account for
the fire. There was Farmer Worth called
her an ugly name once, when she asked for
skimmed milk, and sure enough his cows had
dropped their calves after till he got a goat
to run along with them. Moreover, the
villagers argued, why should a woman be
ejected from her house? Her father had
built the cottage, and it was on three lives,
his, his wife’s and child’s, and now it was
Patience’s as long as the breath was in her.
If she chose to keep it in bad repair that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>her look-out. Because a woman wore rags,
was that a reason why Lord Lamerton and
Mr. Macduff should pull her gown off her
back? Because she had a bad tooth or two
in her head, had they any right to knock out
all the sound teeth in her jaw? Because she
had not patent-leather dancing-pumps, was
she to be forced to go barefoot? Because
she didn’t keep her hair over tidy, was that a
reason why she should have her head shaved?
Lord Lamerton had no right to interfere.
England is a free country, in which folks
may act as they like, and live as they like, so
long as they do not interfere with their
neighbours, and Mrs. Kite had no neighbours.
Her cottage was not within sight of
Orleigh Park—it did his lordship no injury.
Did Mrs. Kite’s kitchen chimney threaten to
fall on Lord Lamerton’s head? Folks, even
lords, have no right to interfere with those
who don’t interfere with them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Popular sympathy went altogether with
Patience Kite. Perhaps at another time the
villagers would have been more disposed to
judge reasonably, but at this juncture they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>were smarting under the sense of wrong
caused by the closing of the manganese
mine, and were therefore disposed to make
common cause with any one against whom
his lordship acted with apparent rigour.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Macduff and his workmen came to
the hovel, they found a number of sympathisers
assembled, mostly miners out of work
and some women.</p>

<p class='c005'>Outside the cottage sat Thomasine. She
had been sent back to her mother from Court
farm because of her sprained ankle, which
incapacitated her for work. Archelaus Tubb
was there also. He, likewise was out of
work—not an unusual condition with him, for
he was a bad workman whatever he took up,
and got his dismissal wherever he went.
The girl was pouting; she had her hands
folded in her lap, and her brows bent. She
looked wonderfully handsome, with a dash of
savagery in her beauty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within the house was Mrs. Kite. She
had put together her few valuables in an oak
chest, and sat on it, near her hearth, with her
feet on the hearthstone and her arms folded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>She would not move. The house might be
dismantled about her, but there she would
remain to the last.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Macduff entered the cottage, and received
a scowl from Thomasine as he passed
her. He endeavoured, but in vain, to persuade
the woman to come outside.</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” said Mr. Macduff, “they’re
about to pu’ the roof down over your
head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Kite made no answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he became angry, and ordered two
masons to enter the ruin and remove the old
woman; but this they were afraid to do.
They pretended that the reason was lest she
should bring an action against them; really,
lest she should “overlook” them; that is,
cast an evil eye upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll give half a sovereign to any who
will bring her out,” offered the agent.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men shrugged their shoulders, and a
miner who was lounging against a tree in the
rear muttered, “If you’re so anxious to get
her out, you and his lordship had best drag
her out yourselves.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Begin with the demolition,” ordered
Macduff.</p>

<p class='c005'>The workmen scrambled on the roof, and
commenced tearing off the old, thin and
rotten thatch, beginning at the end furthest
removed from that where the old woman sat.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few groans and exclamations of
“shame!” issued from the lookers-on.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the thatch was being riven away,
plaster from the rotten ceiling fell, and with
it drifts of straw, into the cottage. Dust
rose, thick and blinding, but Mrs. Kite refused
to stir. She would stifle there rather
than desert her hearth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again Macduff went to the door to expostulate.
The woman answered with a snarl
as a wild beast worried in its lair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on,” shouted Macduff to the men.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then suddenly a tie-beam gave way, and
fell through, with a crash, to the cottage
floor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Immediately ensued a rush of lookers-on
to the cottage door and windows, but the
dust drave out in their faces, thick as steam,
preventing them from seeing anything. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>though Patience could not be seen, her voice
was heard muttering behind the fog of lime
and dust of rotten wood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Macduff did not relish his task. Lord
Lamerton was not present; he had gone to
a ploughing match, where he was to distribute
the prizes. If my lord had been at
home, the agent would have asked for further
directions; but, as he was away, he felt bound
to proceed according to his orders.</p>

<p class='c005'>The workmen engaged on the roof now
discovered that their lunch hour had arrived,
and they descended the ladders with alacrity
to regale themselves on the cake and cold
tea they had brought with them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The pause allowed the dust to clear away,
and Macduff, looking through the doorway,
descried Mrs. Kite, powdered with lime, her
hair almost white, still crouched on her box
in the same place, resting her chin in her
hands, and her elbows on her knees.</p>

<p class='c005'>What was he to do? He bit his lips, and
swore in broad Scotch. The masons were
eating and joking among themselves. The
miners were muttering.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Leisurely—before Macduff had decided on
a course, and reluctantly, the masons refolded
their bundles, and returned to the
ladders.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rip off the straw,” said the agent, “but
be varry careful not to disturb the principals.
If the old creature finds she has nae cover
o’er her head when the rain comes, maybe
she’ll depart of her own accord.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The stripping off of the thatch was resumed,
and the dust fell thicker over the part
of the room where Mrs. Kite sat; it poured
out of every opening, it rose from where the
roof had been torn; the cottage resembled a
smoking dunghill, and the cloud spread over
and enveloped the whole clearing, powdering
grass and bushes, and the coats and boots of
the spectators.</p>

<p class='c005'>All at once, a shout from a mason, then a
crash. He had been astride on a principal
when it had given way and the man had
fallen through the ceiling into the room beneath,
tearing down the laths and plaster
with him, He was not injured, he came forth
a moment later, coughing and sneezing, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>dusty as a miller, and was saluted with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Halloo there!” shouted Macduff. “The
roof is going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The failure of one principal entailed the
fall of the rest; they were dragged out of
place; they slanted on one side, parted from
the chimney, but remained on the walls,
inclined.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thomasine, alarmed for her mother’s
safety, now clung to the door, and cried to
her to come forth. She could see nothing
for the cloud that filled the cottage. Thomasine,
lamed by her sprained ankle, stood at
the door and limped painfully a step forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Arkie! Arkie!” she cried, appealing
to her lover, “do run in and force mother to
come out.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But she will not come,” remonstrated he.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another shout—now of dismay.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The chimney! the chimney!”</p>

<p class='c005'>A crack had suddenly revealed itself. The
rotten loosely-compacted wall had parted.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will be down in a minute! save
her!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Five—I mean one sovereign to any who
will bring her out,” shouted Macduff.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Thomasine grasped Archelaus’
shoulder. “Come,” she said, “I will go—help,
we must save her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will do it,” said the lad and plunged
into the cottage.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment every one held his breath.
Thomasine limped away from the doomed
cottage. All heard the young fellow’s voice
shouting to Mrs. Kite.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, suddenly, the whole chimney came
down with a rush. It was as though it had
closed into itself like a telescope. A dull,
heavy thud, muffled by the dense enveloping
fog of dust, was heard, and then volumes of
yellow smoke-like fumes poured out in gushes
and spirals, and rose in a column above the
cottage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dense though the cloud was, in through it
rushed the men, stumbling over heaps of
stone, and choking in the thick air, but saw
nothing whatever, could see nothing; and
came forth coughing, rubbing their eyes half
suffocated, half blinded.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Nothing could be done, the extent of the
mischief could not be discovered till the
volumes of fine powder, pungent as snuff,
had been given time to clear away, at least
partially.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Macduff plunged in, and stumbled
against Thomasine weeping and wringing
her hands; blindly groping in the opaque
atmosphere, thick as soup. “My mother!
My Arkie! They are both dead! Both
taken from me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stand aside!” shouted the agent. “What
creatures these women are.” He coughed
and growled. “If anything has happened, it
is her fault, she was warned. But the blame
will be put on me.” Then he shouted,
“Tubb! Tubb! Mrs. Kite!” but received
no answer.</p>

<p class='c005'>In at the door came the men again, miners
and masons together, and by crouching they
obtained clearer air, and were better able to
see. The fallen chimney formed a great
heap, and the ruins were spread over the
whole floor; but how high the heap rose
they were unable to distinguish, for the dust-mist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>hung about it, dense, impenetrable,
disclosing only, and that indistinctly, the base
of the mound.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a cry from Thomasine. She had
clasped a hand that protruded from the
rubbish pile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is Arkie! It is Arkie!” she cried.
“He is dead, he has been killed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Run,” ordered Mr. Macduff. “Run,
some of you fellows, for picks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“If he’s dead, you’ve killed ’n,” growled a
miner. “That is—you and my lord.” The
man went forth, whilst the rest, crouching,
wiping their eyes on their cuffs, and wiping
the dust into them, clearing their throats and
choking again, began to pull the stones away.
But the chimney had been built of as much
clay as stone. Though so close to a lime-kiln,
little lime had been used in its construction,
and the slaty stone itself corroded by
weather and the lime which had lain between
its films in the quarry had dissolved to black
powder. A pick did not suffice to remove
the rubbish, shovels were required as well.
The dust did not disperse, every upturn of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the heap sent forth fresh volumes mingled
with soot; but many hands were now engaged,
and in ten minutes Archelaus Tubb
had been extracted, and was carried forth and
laid on the turf outside.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was so covered with dust that he looked
as if made of dark earth, all of one colour—face,
hair, clothing, hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Run for a doctor,” called Macduff.
“Where is he to be taken to? Go on some
of you turning over the heap. Look for Mrs.
Kite, she must be there. Confound the obstinacy
of the woman. I shall be blamed for
this, of course. Always so. The saddle put
on the wrong horse. Some of you get water,
and wash his face, and see where the lad is
hurt. Please stand back, Thomasine, you
can do no good. I will go back and help to
find Mrs. Kite. Why the de’il could she not
have come forth when bidden? She had
warning enough given her.” Then he returned
to the cottage. He was now himself
so covered with dust that the natural colour
of his face and the tincture of his garments
could not be distinguished. Looking up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>from inside the cottage was like looking into
a London fog. There was a great gap where
the chimney had stood, the roof was stripped
of its covering and the principals were inclined
out of their proper positions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said Macduff. “Have you come
on her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We haven’t come on nothing but Arkie
Tubb,” answered one of the men. “There’s

<p class='c005'>“Look sharp about it,” said the agent.
“If she be buried, the only chance of life for
her is to be dug out at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not much chance of life, then,” said one
of the men.</p>

<p class='c005'>A quarter of an hour passed, and Patience
had not been exhumed.</p>

<p class='c005'>A diversion of interest was caused by the
arrival of the surgeon. He examined the
young man, and pronounced that, though he
was not dead, he was so injured that he could
not live beyond an hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>The last heap of fallen chimney-ruin had

<p class='c004'>Lord Lamerton was that day engaged in
distributing prizes at a ploughing match,
about fifteen miles away from Orleigh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear,” said he to his wife before he
started, “for goodness’ sake come with me
into the avenue, and give me the heads of
what I am to say.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Report had it that his lordship got all his
speeches from his wife, and report was not
far wrong in so saying.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll run up to Eggins,” he said, “and get
him to give me some wrinkles about ploughing.
I know nothing concerning it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus primed, partly by one of his farmers
and partly by his wife, his lordship started
for the ploughing match; and on reaching
the ground inspected the furrows with his
glass to his eye, and repeated some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>scraps of information he had gathered from
Eggins.</p>

<p class='c005'>After that came the dinner, and after the
dinner the prize distribution, and a speech
from Lord Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'>His lordship stood up, and coughed. He
was not a fluent speaker, nor a ready speaker;
indeed he could not speak at all unless he
had been given time and opportunity to get
primed. But he had a retentive memory,
and when allowance was made for hesitation,
and repetition, and occasional halts, his
speeches were admitted to be not so bad as
are the generality of such performances.
They read well; only it was a little irritating
to listen to them. The hearer never could
be sure that his lordship would not break
down altogether. Speaking made him and
his audience hot. They perspired sympathetically.
It made him uncertain what to
do with his legs, and those listening to his
words found their attention drawn away to
his inferior members, and were kept in suspense
as to what he would do next with his
extremities. Sometimes he endeavoured to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>stand on one foot, and then he invariably lost
his balance, and grabbed at the table-cloth,
or a lady’s bonnet to stay himself from falling.
On such an occasion he lost the thread of his
discourse, and had to seek it in his pocket-handkerchief,
whilst those listening good-naturedly
stamped and rapped the table, and
shrieked “Hear hear!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes he curled one leg round the
other in such a manner that to recover himself
he was obliged to face about, and he
found himself addressing the latter part of a
sentence to the waiter and the tent wall behind
him, instead of the audience at the table.
It was said that once he put his foot into his
plate on the table, but this was an exaggeration;
he caught himself about to do it and
desisted in time.</p>

<p class='c005'>How is it that the Englishman is so poor
a speaker? I believe that the language is
partly the cause. The English tongue is so
simple in its structure that it runs out of the
mouth faster than the ideas it is supposed to
express have taken shape in the brain.
Consequently we males, sometimes women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>even, say things before we have thought
them out, and then are embarrassed because
the thought lags behind the word, like the
thunder after the flash.</p>

<p class='c005'>In such a language as the German, however,
the mind has to formulate the sentence
in all its ramifications and subsidiary articulations,
before it is uttered. The idea is
kneaded, and squeezed into a shape and then
baked. A tap, and out of the buttered
mould comes the sentence, compact and
complete, whereas, in English, the idea is
not given time to set, it is not even half
baked, and then it is shaken out, and falls to
pieces as it appears; or, like an ill-set jelly,
resolves into an insipid wash.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Lord Lamerton rose to his feet, he
proceeded to blow his nose loudly, then he
looked about him, and his face glowed redly.
He caught the eye of the Rector of Orleigh,
and he said to himself: “Deuce take the
fellow, he will know whence I got this
speech. He was discussing the matter with
my lady the other day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He arranged his legs as best he could to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>support his superincumbent weight, and to
make quite sure of not losing his balance laid
his hand on the back of a chair. Then he
put the other hand into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, “I am
not the sort of man you should have chosen
to speak to you to-day, because——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Interruptions of “No, no!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because, if you allow me, I am not in
the best of moods. I have had an attack, a
damned—I beg your pardon, a dastardly
attack made on me in the public papers, and
I have been—I have been represented—that
is, represented as a monster of iniquity, one
who is ruining the country, and driving trade
out of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, no!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was never more astonished and shocked
in my life. I did think, gentlemen and
ladies, that, if there was one thing I cherished
and loved, and strove to live for it was—that
is to say—it was my country, and next to
my country, my dear old—my dear old
mother county.”</p>

<p class='c005'>General emotion, and some of the ladies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>who had taken more than two glasses of
sherry felt the tears rise into their eyes.
Every gentleman kindled and stamped and
said, “Hear, hear!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But,” continued Lord Lamerton, re-adjusting
his balance, by putting one foot between
the rails of the chair, and the other on
a hat of a gentleman, that was on the floor
near him, and removing his hand from his
trouser to his waistcoat pocket, “but, ladies
and gentlemen, I will pass from personal
matters to the subject in hand.” (Then, to
himself, “Confound the rector, I can see by
the twinkle of his eye that he knows what is
coming.”) “But, ladies and gentlemen, we are
here assembled on an august and interesting
occasion, perhaps one of the most august and
interesting that could have arisen—I mean, I
mean, a ploughing-match. And this recalls
me to the fact that one of our earliest English
poets, William Langland, who lived in the
reign of Richard II., wrote an entire poem
on—what do you suppose? Ploughing.
He entitled his poem, ‘The Vision of Piers
the Ploughman.’ And, what would you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>think gentlemen and ladies, was the drift of
this remarkable composition? We know
that long before, centuries earlier, Virgil
wrote his ‘Georgics,’ in praise of agriculture,
but here, our English poet confined himself
to one branch of agriculture, and that, ploughing.
And the author represents all men—mark
me—<i>all</i> men, as ploughmen, all, from
the king on his throne and the parson in the
pulpit, to the least among us all, as ploughmen
set to make our furrows in the great
field of the world. And, ladies and gentlemen,
each has his own proper furrow to run, and he
may make it well, or make it badly, plough
deep, or merely skirt the soil, plough straight,
or run a feeble, fluttering, irregular line, or he
may even fold his hands, and take a snooze
in the hedge, and make no attempt to
plough.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A pause: the gentleman whose hat had
been converted into a footstool recovered the
crushed article from under the foot of the
speaker, and cast at him a melancholy, reproachful
glance.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beg your pardon, ’pon my soul, I did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>not mean it. I did not observe it.” This
was said aside to the sufferer. Then after a
complete rearrangement of his attitude, with
his legs very wide apart, like that of the
Colossus of Rhodes, Lord Lamerton continued,
“Ladies and gentlemen! I am much
afraid that some of us—I will not say all—for
I do not believe it is true of all—I say
some of us, and God knows, I include myself,
on looking back at our furrows do not find
them as we should have wished; do not derive,
I mean, much satisfaction in the retrospect;
but—but—let me see. Yes!” He
leaned both his hands on the table, so that
his back was curved, and his position was far
from elegant. “But, ladies and gentlemen,
the broad fact remains, that we are all ploughboys
together, and we must take a lesson
from these hearty good fellows we have seen
to-day, and in all we do and undertake, make
our furrows straight, and drive them deep.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hear! Hear! Hear!” and much thumping
and stamping; in the midst of which
Lord Lamerton sat down, and nearly missed
his chair in so doing. Then he leaned over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to the rector, and said, “All my lady’s; ’pon
my soul, all. Never read a line of what’s-his-name
in my life. She has—she reads
everything.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton returned to Orleigh by an
evening train. The station was at some distance
from his place. Only when the new
line was made would he have a station near
at hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>On reaching the Orleigh road station, the
master told him what had occurred during
his absence. His carriage was in waiting
outside to take him home.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bless my heart!” exclaimed his lordship.
“You don’t mean to tell me that Tubb’s son
is dead, and that the old woman has not been
found? Here—” said he to the coachman,
“set me down at the Chillacot turn, and drive
on. I shall walk home, after I have made
enquiries. Deuce take it! I wouldn’t have
had this happen for all I am worth. Poor
Tubb! He is a workman and will feel the
loss of his son, though the fellow was not
good for much—I know that I should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>horribly cut up if anything were to happen to
my cub.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He threw himself into the carriage, and
continued his exclamations of distress and
wonder how it could have come about.
“Macduff must have gone to work clumsily.
Bless the man, he is a machine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The carriage stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shall I attend you, my lord?” asked the
footman at the door, as he held it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Attend me! What for? <i>Me!</i> I’m
going to enquire about the matter, then I
shall go on to Tubb’s cottage. Tell my lady
not to wait dinner.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He swung his umbrella, and walked away.
He marched to the quarry where had been
Patience Kite’s cottage. He thought it possible
that some one might still be on the spot,
and that there he would learn the latest, fullest
and most authentic particulars. That the
old woman had been seen crouched at her
hearth, that the chimney had fallen upon her,
and that she had not been exhumed from the
ruins, was to him inexplicable. When he
came out on the clearing where the ruins of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the cottage stood, Lord Lamerton was surprised
to find it occupied by a crowd. A
lantern was slung to one of the principals of
the roof, above the head of a speaker who
occupied a table that had been drawn out of
the cottage. That speaker was Mr. James
Welsh. Lord Lamerton did not know him
by sight, only by reputation.</p>

<p class='c005'>As my lord appeared on the scene, those
there assembled shrank aside, with a look of
confusion and shyness. He listened for a
moment to the orator, and then proceeded to
push his way through the throng, which
divided to allow him to pass; and, approaching
the table, he said, “I beg your pardon,
sir; I have not the honour of knowing your
name; but you are making pretty free with
mine. What is it all about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are Lord Lamerton, I presume?”
said the orator, looking at the dismayed faces
of those within the radiance of the lantern.
“The saying goes that listeners hear no good
of themselves. Perhaps it may be true in
this case.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have not been listening, but I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>caught a sentence or two; and I have no idea of
allowing anyone taking liberties with my name
behind my back. If you have anything to
say about me, say it to my face. What is all
this about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is all this about?” repeated the orator.
“His noble lordship, the Right Honourable
Giles Inglett, Baron Lamerton, asks, What is
all this about?” In a lower tone charged with
oratorical irony, “<i>What</i> is all this about?” Mr.
Welsh looked round on his audience. “Having
shut up his manganese mine, and reduced
a hundred men to destitution, broken up their
homes, obliged them to wander over the face
of the earth in quest of work, without houses
of their own, without bread to put into the
mouths of their children, forced to sell their
poor sticks of furniture down to the baby’s
cradle—he asks, What is all this about?
After having torn down a house over the
head of a poor widow, and bespattered her
grey hairs with gore, he asks, What is all
this about? After having deprived a father
of his only child, and an orphan of her mother,
he has the effrontery—yes—in the face of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>lordship I repeat the word, I repeat it in the
boldness which my righteous indignation
gives me—the effrontery to ask, What is all
this about? Possibly, when Cain saw his
brother, his younger brother Abel, lying at
his feet, with fractured skull and crushed
limbs, he also asked, What is all this about?
I will not pretend to know where his lordship
has been all day; but I do say that, as an
Englishman, as a Christian, as a man, when
he was about to render desolate the heart of
a father by taking the life of his only son,
and of a child by bereaving her of her mother,
when he was about to tear the roof off from
over the head of the widow and the fatherless,
he should have been <i>here</i>, yes, here and
not far away—Heaven knows where—in
what scene of riot and revelry, into which
decent folk like us would not venture to look.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now come,” said Lord Lamerton, “this
is all rubbish. I have been at a ploughing
match. I want to know what you are doing
here. Who the deuce are you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord,” said the orator, “I am—I
rejoice to say it—one of the People, one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the down-trodden and ill-treated, the excluded
from the good things of life. My heart, my
lord, beats in the right place. Where yours
is, my lord, it is not for me, it is for your
own conscience to decide. But mine, mine—is
in the right place. I am one of the
people, and my lord, let me inform you that
when you insult me, you insult the entire
people of England; you bespatter not me
only, but the whole of that enlightened,
hearty, intelligent people, of whom I see so
many noble, generous specimens before me—you
bespatter them, I repeat, my lord, you
bespatter them in the grossest and most unwarranted
fashion—with dirt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Pon my soul,” interrupted Lord Lamerton,
rapping on the table, “I can make no
heads nor tails out of all this. If you have
anything against me, say it out. If you want
anything, tell it me plainly. I am not unreasonable,
but I’m not going to stand here
and listen to all this rigmarole.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Perhaps, my lord, you are not aware,
that there are many grievances under which
the Public, the Public, my lord, are groaning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Shall I begin with the lighter, and
proceed to the graver, or reverse the process?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As you please. It is one to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well,” said Welsh. He looked
round complacently on his audience, and
rubbed his hands. “His lordship, in all
simplicity of heart, wants to know what
occasion he has given for this indignation.
What occasion,” with a chuckle, and those
who could see his face and catch his tone
chuckled also. “What occasion,” with sarcasm,
and his audience felt their gall rise.
“What occasion,” in a hollow thrilling tone,
and the crowd responded with a groan.
“Shall we tell his lordship? We will, and
we will begin with some of the lighter grievances,
heavy in themselves, but light in comparison
with the others. In the first place,
what does he mean by throwing open the
grounds on a Tuesday, a day when the public,
as he knows, the hard-working public
which needs relaxation and the sight of the
beautiful, cannot enjoy the boon? Is that, I
ask, a day when the shops are closed? Is it
a day when the sons of toil in our cities can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>get away from their labours and admire the
beauties of nature, and the charms of art?
It is not. The grounds are thrown open on
Tuesdays, with almost fiendish malevolence
and the cunning of the serpent, that his lordship
may obtain the credit of liberality, whilst
doing nothing to deserve it. The true public
are excluded by the selection of the day, but
the gentle-folks, the parsons, the squires, and
all the do-nothings, to whom one day is as
another, they can see Orleigh Park on Tuesdays.
If Lord Lamerton had in him any
true humanity, any sympathy for the tradesman,
for the clerk, for the milliner and the
seamstress, he would open on—let us say
Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well,” said Lord Lamerton, “I
have no objection in the world, except that
it will give the gardeners more to do, picking
up the papers and scraps—henceforth the
grounds shall be open to the public on
Saturdays.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, my lord, are the pictures and
statuary and other works of art to be shown
only to the aristocratic eye and are they to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>be carefully kept within closed doors from
the profane gaze of what you contemptuously
call—The Common People?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not at all,” said Lord Lamerton. “I
will order that the state apartments be
opened on Saturdays—though, Lord knows,
above a questionable Van Dyck, there are no
great shakes in the way of pictures there. Is
that all?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is not all,” proceeded Mr. James
Welsh. “Lord Lamerton innocently—I
will not say, sheepishly—asks, Is that all?
No, I reply, and I reply as the mouth-piece
of all present, as the shout of the democracy
of England. It is not all. It is very far
from being all. Is that all? he asks, standing
before you, out of whose mouths he has
snatched the crust of bread, the staff of life.
Is that all? When he closes the manganese
mine, and throws almost the entire population
of Orleigh out of employ, and scatters
them everywhere, hungry, homeless, forlorn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, this is a trifle too extravagant,”
said Lord Lamerton. “The mine would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>have gone under my house and brought it
down. Why, it would have cost me
twenty thousand pounds to rebuild the
house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You hear that! Twenty thousand pounds
which might have been spent in Orleigh
is refused the people. Twenty thousand
pounds! How many able-bodied men are
there in Orleigh? About two hundred.
What might you not have done with a hundred
pounds each? What comforts might you
not have provided yourselves with? But his
lordship buttons up his pockets. Look upon
yourselves, each of you, as defrauded of a
hundred pounds. My lord will bank his
twenty thousand. He does not want it. He
hoards it. He fossilizes it. There is a
fable about a dog in the manger which
snarled at the horses that wanted to eat out
of that manger which was of no use at all to
the hound.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Lord Lamerton raised his voice,
and said, “My good friends, I don’t believe
you are so weak as to be gulled by these
fallacies. Why should I allow my house to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>be undermined and rattled down about my
ears, if I can help it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>A voice from the throng shouted, “Good
for trade.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some one has said,” continued Lord
Lamerton, “some one has remarked that it
would be good for trade. I dispute this. I
deny it energetically. I say that it would
cost me twenty thousand pounds to rebuild
the place, but I do not say that—if ousted
by the manganese mine, I would rebuild it.
Why should I? If I built on any rock, how
could I tell but that some vein of metal
would again be found under it, and then I
might be driven away once more. Or if I
built on clay, some company might insist on
exploring the clay for aluminium; or if I
built on gravel, it might be insisted on to
under-dig me for coprolites, for the formation
of artificial manure. Why, I say, should
I risk my twenty thousand pounds when my
very foundations are no security for the
outlay? I would say to myself: As there
is no security any where, I will spend my
twenty thousand pounds in amusing myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>on the Continent, on personal jewellery—or
God knows what selfish luxuries. Security
of property, unassailability of right of property,
that is the basis of all prosperity in
trade. Touch property, and down goes
trade with it. Look at the Jews in past
times. They had no security, so they
hoarded, and never spent a farthing they
could not help. They did nothing for trade
with their wealth. Touch property, and no
one with money will do other than did the
Jews. Touch property, and down goes
trade.” Lord Lamerton thumped the table.
“Now look here, I don’t want to be hard on
any one. I have lost a great deal of money
already on the manganese, which has not
paid for these five years, but has been
worked at a dead loss. I don’t see my way
to lose more, and to endanger, moreover, the
walls of my house. That is plain sense.
But as I say, I won’t be hard on any one.
If the miners cannot get work elsewhere, I’ll
set them road-making. They can cut a new
road as soon as ever it is settled where the
station is to be, and hedge and stone it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>That will cost me a thousand pounds, if it
will cost me a penny.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just listen to this proposal,” shouted
Welsh, who found that the plain sense of
Lord Lamerton was producing some effect.
“You hear his lordship’s magnanimous offer.
He will take you honest, hearty, active
mining fellows and debase you to stone-breakers
by a road-side. He has had such
experience in heart-breaking, that he thinks
to set you a job that commends itself to his
fancy—stone-breaking. But let us pass
from this. I have not done with my noble
lord yet. Not by any means. The last of
his misdeeds is not yet quite exhausted. I
want to ask the Right Honourable Baron
Lamerton how it is that he is so sensitive
about the tumbling down of his own house,
and so ready by the hands of his Macduffs
and other minions to tear down the walls of
the widow’s cottage? I ask him that. See—he
is confounded, he cannot answer.”
Welsh looked round triumphantly. “Nor is
that all,” he pursued; “I have another
question to put, to which also, I have no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>doubt, I shall meet with silence only as an
answer. His lordship who is so touchy
about the rights of property is, I suspect,
only touchy about the rights of his <i>own</i>
property. I have it on the best possible
authority that he is threatening to dispossess
a man whom we all esteem, Captain Saltren,
to dispossess him of his house and land, a
house built by his father and repaired and
beautified by himself. I believe I am not
wrong in saying that he has threatened to
employ law against our valued friend, Captain
Saltren.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A cry of “Shame, shame!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” pursued the orator, “it is shame.
What was that his lordship said just now
about rights of property? Touch property,
he insisted, and down goes trade. Who is
touching property. Who but he? Who
lays his envious grasp—he, Ahab, on the
vineyard of the poor Naboth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the orator jumped off the table, and
in a changed tone said to Lord Lamerton,
“I must be off and report this meeting.
I’ve a train to catch. Give you a leader on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>it, old cock. No offence meant; none I
hope taken. Both of us men of the world,
and know how to live by it. I know as well
as you what is gammon, but gammon is the
staple diet of the chawbacon. Give us your
hand.” He nudged the nobleman in the
side. “Bamboozled, my lord, eh? I am
James Welsh. Pretty considerably bamboozled,
eh?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXVI.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>DUMFOUNDERED.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When James Welsh sprang from the table,
and held out his hand, Lord Lamerton was
in that condition of bamboozlement that he
did not know what to do, whether to mount
the table and address the audience, or to walk
away; whether to accept the proffered hand,
or to refuse it. He felt as does a boy who
has been blindfolded and set in the midst of
a room to be spun about, struck, and bidden
catch his persecutors, but who finds himself
unable to touch one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whatsoever he said was caught from his
lips and converted into a fresh charge against
him; every kindness he proposed was perverted
into an act of barbarity.</p>

<p class='c005'>And then—after he had been thus treated,
his persecutor bounced down before him, and
in the most cheery tone in the world, declared
that no offence was intended, asked him if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>were bamboozled, and invited him to shake
hands. Lord Lamerton was no match for
his assailant. He was not a ready man.
When he had been primed by his wife, or
after laborious preparation, he was able to
produce the collected matter, but neither
smoothly nor naturally. His sentences came
from him as liquid issues from a barrel unprovided
with a vent. They flowed for a
while, then stopped, and a gulp ensued, after
that a drop or two; another gulp, and then a
rush of words forming a sentence, or, more
probably, a sentence and a half. An interruption
confused Lord Lamerton, a question
silenced him. He was deficient in precisely
those qualities which Mr. Welsh possessed
in perfection—ready wit, assurance, bluntness
of feeling qualities essential to the successful
orator. Welsh knew exactly how to keep in
touch with his audience, he could gauge their
ignorance at a glance, and would always
accommodate himself to their capacity. He
had unbounded audacity, because utterly
without scruple; he had smartness, and skill
in parrying.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Lord Lamerton stood back. The night
was not dark, but the trees cast shadows
about the glade where the meeting was held,
and the lantern cast but a feeble light. His
movements could be seen only by those who
were close to him, and in his condition of
bamboozlement, he was glad to take advantage
of the opening made in the throng by Welsh,
to follow and place himself outside the crowd.
He did not leave altogether; he remained to
see what would follow, and to gather together
his scattered senses. He leaned against the
bole of a Scotch pine, and looked on unobserved.
Those who had noticed that he had
passed through concluded that he had left
entirely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a thing it is,” muttered Lord
Lamerton, “to have the gift of assurance.
That fellow was all in the wrong, and I was
all in the right, but I could not explain my
right, and he was able to make all I said seem
wrong. ’Pon my soul, I don’t believe that he
was in earnest, and believed in what he said.
I couldn’t do that, God bless me! I couldn’t
do that and look my lady in the face again.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Suddenly Captain Saltren appeared on the
table vacated by Welsh. He looked more
gaunt, hollow-eyed and pale than usual, but
this may have been the effect of the lantern-light
falling from above on his prominent
features. The moment he appeared he was
greeted with clapping of hands and cheers.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Lord Lamerton looked on, he thought
the scene was strangely picturesque, it was
like a meeting of old Scotch Covenanters.
To the north, the sky was full of twilight,
but black clouds drove over it, flying rapidly,
though little wind was perceptible below.
Against the silvery light rose the well-wooded
hill with spires of pine, and larch,
and spruce, like one of those fantastic prospects
of a mediæval city in Doré’s night
pictures. In front was the ruined cottage
with the yellow lantern, suspended from a
projecting beam, and in its radiance the form
of the mining captain as wild as the surroundings.
Between the looker-on and the table
were the figures of men, boys, and some
women, partially illumined by the pale twilight
from above, partially by the yellow halo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>of the lantern. Now and then a match was
struck, as a man lit his pipe, and then, there
was a flare, and the heads that intervened
were distinctly seen, black against the
momentary flash.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren looked from side to side, and waved
his arms. As he did so, the fingers of his
right hand came within the direct rays of the
lantern, and were seen quivering and in
movement as though he were engaged in
playing a piece of rapid music on an unseen
instrument. And in truth, he was so doing,
and doing it unconsciously. From these
long, thin, thrilling fingers, invisible threads
attached themselves to the nerves of those
who stood before him, and before he spoke,
before he opened his mouth, a magic, altogether
marvellous accord was established
between him and those who surrounded him.
It is told of St. Anthony of Padua that he
was once asked to preach to an audience
whose tongue he could not speak, and who
understood not a word of Italian. He went
up into the pulpit, looked round, and all in
the church went into paroxysms of contrition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and tears, and—he had not said a word.
The secret of this power is intensity of conviction
and absolute sincerity. Saltren was
convinced and sincere. The look of his face,
the agitation of his limbs, the convulsive
movements of his lips all proclaimed his
sincerity.</p>

<p class='c005'>The captain, moreover, was known to all
those who now looked up to him, known as
a man of probity, true in all he said and just
in all he did, a blameless man. But though
his blamelessness commanded respect, there
was in him, something beyond the blamelessness
that commanded respect; and that
something was his spirituality. Men felt and
acknowledged that there existed in him a
mysterious link with the unseen world. All,
even the dullest were aware, when speaking
with Captain Saltren, that they were in the
presence of a man who lived in two worlds,
and principally in that which was supersensual
and immaterial. He impressed the
people of Orleigh—as did Patience Kite—with
awe. These two belonged to the same
category of beings who lived in an atmosphere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of the supernatural; the captain talked
with angels, and Patience Kite with, perhaps,
devils. The influence both exerted was not
confined to the ignorant, it extended to those
who were partially educated; perhaps he
influenced these latter even more than the
former. In the general flux and disintegration
of belief, those who were most aware of
the <i>débacle</i> clung most tenaciously to the skirts
of such who still remained convinced. Now
Mrs. Kite, however sceptical she might be in
religious matters, had no doubt whatever in
her own powers, and Captain Saltren was
profoundly rooted in his own convictions,
and this was the source of the strength of
both.</p>

<p class='c005'>As he stood on the table, his limbs trembled
as though he were stricken with the
ague, his mouth quivered, sweat streamed
from his face. He could not speak, emotion
overpowered him. He waved his hands, and
his fingers clutched at the air, and he looked
nervously from side to side.</p>

<p class='c005'>A woman screamed, fell on her knees, and
shrieked for mercy. She thought she was at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a revivalist meeting, and the movement of
Saltren’s hands had caught every nerve in
her head and had drawn together and knotted
them, so that she shrieked with the tension
insupportable.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My friends and fellow sufferers,” began
Saltren. The cry of the woman had unloosed
his tongue, for it proclaimed that sympathy
was established between him and his hearers.
“I have doubted”—he spoke slowly, in a
low tone, with tremor in his tones, and with
diffidence—“I have doubted whether I should
address you or not. I do not desire to speak.
I am held back, and yet I am thrust on. I
am like an anchored vessel with the sails
spread and the wind filling them. The
anchor must part, or the sails be torn to
shreds. The anchor is in the earth, the
breath of heaven is in the sails. I know
which ought to go. But there is strain—great
strain;” he paused and passed his hand
over his face, and it came away dripping with
moisture. “I have no natural gift. I am
fearful of myself. I cannot speak as did
James Welsh. I am no scholar. I am an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>ignorant man. But so were the apostles,
taken from their nets, and so was Levi taken
from the receipt of custom. So was Elisha,
drawn from the plough. I hang back. I
can say with David, my heart is not haughty,
nor mine eyes lofty. Surely I have behaved
and quieted myself as a child that is weaned
of his mother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the woman, kneeling, began again to
scream, “Lord, have mercy! have mercy!”
and her cries assisted in thrilling and exciting
the speaker and people alike. Some of the
audience began to groan and sigh. One
young bumpkin from behind called out, “We
don’t want no sarmon. If you’re going to
preach, I’m off.” Then ensued a commotion;
heads were turned, exclamations of
anger and disgust greeted the interruption,
and the lad was hustled away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren resumed his speech, when the interruption
was over and quiet restored.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am,” he said, “a quiet man. I keep to
myself and to my own concerns. So was
Gideon a quiet man, keeping to himself and
his farm. But the spirit of prophecy came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>on him, and he was summoned to lead the
people against Midian, and to smite the
enemy hip and thigh, and utterly to destroy
them.” The tones of his voice became
firmer and deeper. His hearers trembled as
he trembled, and their hearts quivered with
every vibration of his voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton listened with amazement.
He and that ploughboy who had called out
in mockery were the only two in that assembly
who had not fallen under the influence
of the orator, one because he was cultivated
beyond its reach, the other because he was
spiritually sunk beneath it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The clouds had now formed a black canopy
overhead, and as a pause ensued in the address
of Saltren, the rush of the wind could
be heard in the tree-tops.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There was neither sword nor spear found
among the Israelites,” continued Saltren,
“and yet they overthrew their enemies, and
the way was scattered with their garments
and weapons as far as Jordan. I am an
ignorant and a foolish man, and yet I am
sent to you commissioned from above. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>cannot forbear, for I am driven on. Moses
was in favour with the Egyptians, and yet
he threw away his advantages because of the
sighing and the groaning of his people. I have
had no favour with the Egyptians, but I have
been sent to lead Israel out of captivity. I
would keep silence, but I may not. I have
had a call as had Jonah, and if I try like him
to fly, I shall be brought back. I must deliver
my message. If I were sunk in the
sea, the sea would throw me up. If I were
covered by the mountains falling, I should
come forth to proclaim the message. That
is why I stand here before you. I have
wrestled with myself. I have shrunk from
declaring what I have seen and heard, but if
I were to hold my peace, I should be broken
as a rotten branch, and be consumed in the
fire. Therefore I must speak.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He paused and drew a long breath, and
again wiped his brow. All the audience
drew a long breath with him. Overhead the
wind muttered and puffed, and along the
horizon at the back the dark spires bent and
righted themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day,”
said Saltren, and at once, as he said the
words, the man was changed. His tremors
ceased, his knees no longer shook, he stood
firm with head erect, and with a face as that
of a frozen man and his hands clasped before
his breast.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was in the spirit on the Lord’s day,”
he repeated. “I was here, hard by, down
by the water—no, on the water, in the old
quarry, engaged in prayer. Then, suddenly,
I saw a light from heaven above the brightness
of the sun, and I was as one dazzled
and in a trance; and I heard a voice, like
the voice of a trumpet calling to me, and
saying, Saltren, Saltren, Saltren! Then,
before I could answer, I saw an angel flying
in the midst of heaven, having a little book
in his hand, and he held it aloft, and cried,
‘This is the Book of the Everlasting Gospel,
this is the truth hid from the earth for ten
thousand years, and now at length revealed
unto men.’ Then I cried, Give me the book.
And the angel cast it down, and said, ‘This is
the Everlasting Gospel, all men are equal, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>are the sons of the one Adam, and are
children of one family. There shall be no
more rich and poor, noble and common; all
shall be equal, and so all shall be one.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then some of those who heard, carried
away by their emotions, began to leap and
hold up their hands, and cry, “Glory, Allelulia!”
and the woman on her knees was
joined by others who united in cries for
mercy. For a few moments a whirlwind of
groans and exclamations and general commotion
swept over the assembly, and as suddenly
died away again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then,” continued Saltren, “Then the
angel cast down the book, and it fell into the
water, but as it fell I read thereon the title,
<i>The Gilded Clique</i>. And what, I ask, is the
gilded clique, which like a sponge, sucks in
all the wealth of the country and gives nothing
back? What is the gilded clique which
claims to itself nobility and gentility, and
calls us common and unclean? What is
the gilded clique which sits alone, firm on its
strong foundations struck in the earth, and
drives us from place to place in search of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>work and food? Which denies to all but
itself sure and lasting homes, and a certain
future? What is the gilded clique which
carries corruption into our families, and
blights the land with its vices? The gilded
clique! Such are they. A handful of dirt!
Such are we. But where are truth and
righteousness, diligence and honesty to be
found? Among them? In the gilded
clique? or among us, in the handful of dirt?
The day of reckoning is approaching, already
has one seal of the seven been unclasped,
and I have read what it is to be, and what I
have read, that must I proclaim. As I
wrestle night and day in prayer, more and
more of the contents of the book are disclosed
to me. When it fell from heaven, I
saw only the cover and what was thereon,
but since then, when I am in prayer, I am
shown the book and the seals, and one after
another is unclosed, and I read further.
Time will reveal what is now hidden from
your eyes. Only have confidence, and look
forward.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As Saltren talked, he worked himself out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of the constraint with which he had begun,
and he spoke easily, fluently, as one inspired,
speaking with authority; and his action as he
addressed the audience was dignified, serious
and easy. His voice was full, deep and
sonorous, and his eye flashed with conscious
power. Whilst he was speaking, a few drops
of rain began to fall, large and warm; and
the sky overhead was black with cloud.
Behind, in the ruined cottage, strange,
spectral, blue flashing lights began to play,
seen at first on the threshold, then on the
hearth, and then dancing from one end to
another of the hovel. The course of the
flame could not be traced by those without,
because the walls intervened, but it was seen
quivering at the broken doorway, and then
through the shattered window.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who stood near the cottage, shrank
from it, cowering back, pressing on those
behind, and leaving a space between them
and the table, and the house where these
ghostly lights moved about. Saltren alone
was unconscious of what passed in the ruin,
for his back was to it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“We have our misery brought home to
us,” he continued. “Why are we thrown
out of work? Why am I threatened with
having my house taken from me? Why is
this cottage torn down, and the stones cast
upon an innocent man to crush the life out
of him? The Lord has suffered all this to
come upon us at once, so as to rouse us to a
knowledge of the truth revealed to me that
all are equal, and in our equality are one;
and that the time has arrived when the poor
are to rise and put their feet on the necks of
their oppressors. I saw on the cover of that
book which descended to me from above the
clouds, the head of a man, and the cover was
red with blood, and I saw how that that man
was handed over first to destruction, the first
among many; and I know how that the heads
of those predestined to destruction will
appear in order, one after another, on the cover
of the book, as the sentence goes forth against
each. He who comes first is the chief offender,
he who has caused so much woe, he who has
destroyed the peace of homes, that one—”</p>

<p class='c005'>A shout of “Name, name!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Then, suddenly, from within the ruin flared
up a vivid conflagration golden yellow, so
brilliant as to light up the faces of all present
turned to the speaker, and convert every leaf
of every tree into a flake of gold.</p>

<p class='c005'>Women shrieked, then were instantaneously
hushed, hushed as in death, for,
standing on the table behind Saltren, they
saw Patience Kite, wild, ragged, with her
hair about her shoulders, and an arm extended,
pointing. Saltren, also, by the vivid
glare, saw Lord Lamerton under the Scotch
fir, his face catching full the reflection, as if
illumined by the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you ask his name?” he shouted.
“He is there.” He also pointed, and all the
while was unconscious that the wild woman
near him was indicating the same man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the whole assembly turned to look,
and for a moment saw Lord Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a moment only, for the flame fell, and
cries, piercing, thrilling every nerve, distracted
the attention of the crowd. A woman
had fallen in convulsions on the ground,
declaring that she had seen the Devil.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXVII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>FLOUTED.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Lord Lamerton put his hand to his head—he
could not have spoken if addressed, he
was dumfoundered. After the assault delivered
by James Welsh, he might possibly have
blundered through some sort of self-exculpation,
but the attack of Captain Saltren was
so amazing, so unexpected, so different in
kind from anything against which he was
armed, that he could not speak, could not
utter a syllable.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was all at once caught by the arm, and
saw the faces of Jingles and Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord,” said young Saltren, hastily,
“you must not stay here. The people are
incensed, and may do you an injury.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton looked from the tutor to
his daughter, and then back again. What
had brought him there? Why had Arminell
thus acted in disobedience to his wishes, and
against common decorum? But he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>nothing, he was struck dumb. The world
was turned upside down, and those who had
stood on their feet were now on their heads.</p>

<p class='c005'>Young Saltren took his arm, and he allowed
himself to be led away.</p>

<p class='c005'>He did not recover at once from his bewilderment.
He was as a man stunned.
What he had experienced that night was unlike
any other experience he had gone through.
A sense of helplessness momentarily came
upon him, of inability to resist the forces of
fanaticism, unscrupulous partisanship, superstition
and prejudice gathered against him.
He could neither descend to the personalities
and dishonesties of Welsh, nor climb to the
fantastic extravagance of Saltren.</p>

<p class='c005'>Like a plain Englishman he liked to fight
face to face with his antagonist on open
ground, and on a level, to hit straight before
him, and give hard blows; but he was taken
in flank, and bewildered among the tortuous
defiles into which he was drawn by Welsh,
and unable to touch Saltren who menaced
him from aerial heights.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are two sorts of culture, as there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>two eyes and two ears, and two hands, and
two feet to every man, and two poles to the
globe, and two lights to rule the day and
night. But these two cultures are very different
in their effects.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man without intellectual culture has
strong opinions, is rugged and angular, and
is unable to conceive of the possibility of any
qualifications to what he holds as the truth.
As he becomes cultivated, he is cut into more
facets, and rubbed down, and still further culture
makes the angles obtuse and multiplies
the facets till finally he loses all angles, and
becomes a globe. Friction among his fellow
men has rubbed away every sharpness of
opinion, till with perfect culture he ceases to
have any opinions at all. Let us put the
same fact in another way. The rude man
comes out of the dye-vat intense in the colour
of his opinions, but every dip he gets in
mixed society runs some of his colour out of
him, and after having been plunged a good
many times in the social wash-tub he ceases
to have any distinguishable colour whatever.
Intellectual culture makes a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>moderate and tolerant, because he becomes
indifferent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moral culture has an opposite effect. The
uncultivated moral faculty is dull, and blunt to
discriminate between right and wrong; the
moral palate requires training, for by nature
it tastes only what is crude, and distinguishes
sharp extremes. The discipline of life, many
a painful experience, and some humiliation,
serve to train the moral faculty to nice distinction,
and teach it to shrink from the
smallest sources of falsehood, to avoid the
rank and gross, and to acquire the strictest
love of justice. It learns to enjoy the soft
velvety port, and to pass the brandied logwood
untouched.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton was a man of double culture.
He was not a man of brains, but he
was thoroughly scrupulous and honourable,
eminently a fair man, and essentially truthful.
As such he was incapable of meeting Welsh.
His <i>moral</i> culture had disarmed him for such
a combat. He was like a man called to duel,
handling a polished rapier, and engaged with
an antagonist armed with a revolver. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the other hand, his <i>intellectual</i> culture incapacitated
him from meeting Captain Saltren.
Such a craze as that of his about a vision of
an angel bearing the Everlasting Gospel was
a craze and nothing more, undeserving of
being argued about, entitling the holder to a
cell in Bedlam.</p>

<p class='c005'>Political unscrupulousness and fanatical
unreason were united against him, and although
he was aware that they were powerless
to injure him, still they might cause him
considerable annoyance. It is never pleasant
to be on bad terms with neighbors, however
removed from them one may be in class and
fortune. It is like living in a land haunted by
malaria. You are safe on your toft of high
land, and look down on the vaporous and
poisonous region below, but it hems you in,
it interferes with your independence, you have
to reckon upon it, and avoid it. To Lord
Lamerton it was intolerable to be on other
terms than the best with every one, and he
was ruffled and hurt by lack of cordiality and
want of reciprocity.</p>

<p class='c005'>How could he bring these misguided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>people to their senses? It would not do for
him to send Macduff among them. Macduff
was a Scotchman, and did not understand
the ways of thought of the Southerners. He
was himself unable to do anything. He put
his hand to his head—he was utterly dumfoundered.</p>

<p class='c005'>All this while he was walking away, led by
the tutor, and had his daughter on the other
side of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, abruptly, Lord Lamerton asked,
“How long have you been listening to that—to—I
mean—him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“O, papa, we have only just arrived, as
dinner is over,” answered Arminell. “I heard
from Mr. Saltren that there was to be a
meeting of protest at the ruined cottage, and
I persuaded him to accompany me to it.
But we came late—and now the rain has begun
to pour down, it will disperse the assembly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you know I was here?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—I heard you had walked on to
Captain Tubb’s house to make enquiries.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton disengaged his arm from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that of Jingles, who still held it, and said,
“Mr. Saltren, your way lies to Chillacot.
You are no doubt going to your father, and
will be glad to remain with him. I will give
orders that your clothes and other possessions
be removed to-morrow. Things necessary
for the night shall be sent at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My lord!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wish you a very good evening, Mr.
Saltren, and a good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Lord Lamerton took his daughter’s
arm, and walked hastily away. The rain
was beginning to fall heavily.</p>

<p class='c005'>He said nothing more for some distance,
and Arminell remained silent. But when
the park gates were reached, he spoke, and
his voice shook as he did so.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Arminell, this is too bad, this is direct
and deliberate revolt. It is not enough for
me to be attacked from without, but I must
encounter treason in the camp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will not pretend to misunderstand you,
papa,” said Arminell. “You are annoyed at
my coming out at night with Mr. Saltren—with
Giles senior.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Arminell!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sorry to have caused you annoyance,
but, papa, in the first place I was desirous
of seeing the meeting, and hearing
what was said at it, and of judging for myself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of hearing your own father abused, insulted
and denounced.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not exactly that, papa; but surely there
is wrong on both sides.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you constituted yourself judge over
your father!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No papa, I wished to hear what was
said, and I asked—you know whom I mean—to
come with me. It may possibly have
been indiscreet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not merely indiscreet, but wrong, for it
was an act of deliberate, wilful disobedience
to the wishes of your father, plainly expressed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not wish to vex and disobey you,
papa, but I will exercise my independence
and judgment. I cannot allow myself to be
cooped in the cage of proprieties. I must
see what is going on, and form my own
opinions.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Very well—you shall go to your Aunt
Hermione. Your step-mother is not good
enough for you. I—your father—am not
good enough for you. We are all too strait-laced,
too tied hand and foot by the laces of
respectability, to serve as a guide or check
on such a headstrong piece of goods as yourself.
You go to Hermione next week.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not wish to go to her. I dislike
her. I detest the sort of life led in her
house, a life utterly hollow, frivolous and insincere.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She is a woman of the world.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A woman of the world that is passing
away. I am standing with one foot on a
world that is coming on, and I will not step
back on to the other.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You go to Aunt Hermione,” said Lord
Lamerton peremptorily. He was losing his
temper.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How long am I to be with her?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That depends. Your mother has written
to ask her to receive you for six months.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Six months!” Arminell disengaged herself
from her father. “Six months is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>eternity, I cannot! I will not submit to
this. I shall do something desperate. I
detest that old Hermione. Her voice grates
on my nerves, her laugh raises my bad
passions. I can hardly endure her for six
days. Her good nature is imbecility itself,
and provokes me; her vanity makes her
ridiculous. I cannot, indeed, I will not go
to her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must, Armie! It is my wish—it is
my command.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But not for six months. Six weeks is
the outside of my endurance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Armie, I heartily wish that there were
no necessity for parting with you at all, but
you have given me and your mother such
cause for anxiety, and such pain, that we have
concluded together that it is best for you and
us to be separated for a while. You, I have
said, give me pain, especially now at a time
when I am worried by external troubles. I
cannot force you to go to your aunt’s, nor
force you to remain there longer than you
choose, but you know my intentions, and
they are for your good, and our own relief.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Am I such an annoyance to you?” asked
Arminell, in a subdued tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course, with your waywardness, and
open defiance of our authority, you are. You
have made me—let alone my lady—very unhappy.
You have set yourself up to disagree
with us at every point, to run counter
to all our wishes, and to take up with persons
with whom we disapprove of your associating.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I give you pain, papa?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very much pain indeed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you think it would make you happier
if I left Orleigh, and that it would also be
better for me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And six months, you suppose, will cure
me of my wilfulness?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not say that; that depends on yourself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anyhow, for six months you will have
ease of mind if I am away from you, and in
good hands?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In good hands, certainly. Hermione’s
house is a very suitable school. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>there be brought to understand that deference
is due to your superiors, consideration for the
feelings of others, respect for opinions that
differ from your own, and especially that regard
is to be had for <i>les convenances</i>, without
which social life would go to pieces, as a
chain of pearls that has lost its connecting
links. <i>Les convenances</i> may be, and indeed
are, in themselves nothing, but they hold
society together. You have been left too
much to yourself or with unsatisfactory
governesses. You must be taught your proper
place. You must go into the stream of social
life, and feel the current and its irresistible
force.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, papa, I will go.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your aunt will be sure to write to-day;
we shall have a letter to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell said nothing. Her brows were
knit and her lips set.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am sorry we have to give up the trip
to Switzerland; it might have been pleasant,
had we been all together, but I must deny
myself that. The Irish property has brought
in nothing; and I have lost money in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>ways; now I must set the men to work on
the new road—that is, if they will condescend
to make it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>On reaching the house, Lord Lamerton
went at once to the drawing-room, and caught
his wife dozing over a magazine. He put
his hand on her shoulder, and said,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Julia!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She started, and dropped her book.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you are back at last! Have you had
anything to eat?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“More than I am able to digest, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did the speech succeed? You remembered
Langland’s date, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, I have heard too many speeches
to-day to remember anything about my own—that
is to say, yours. I have had three—one
from Mr. Welsh, one from Captain
Saltren, and one from Arminell, and upon my
soul, I do not know which was the most unpleasant.
Do you know where Arminell has
been since dinner?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In her room, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; she has been out—with Jingles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Her ladyship looked blank.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a fact. She went with him to a
meeting held by the malcontents against me;
went to hear what they had to say against
her own father, and went with that fellow with
whom you had cautioned her not to be seen, and
whom I had forbidden to associate with her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good gracious! how improper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The girl is unmanageable. However, I
have got her to promise to go to her Aunt
Hermione for a bit, if Hermione will take
her. I tried to make her agree to six months,
but I am not sure that I can bring her to
consent to so long a banishment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—to go out with Jingles, after all that
has been said to her!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And for him to have the audacity to take
her out—and to such a meeting.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“They must have gone out immediately
after dinner. You have not dined?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have swallowed a good deal to-day,”
he said with an attempt at a smile. “I have
been bamboozled by Welsh, dumfoundered
by Saltren, and flouted by Arminell.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXVIII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A CONTRETEMPS.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The inquest on young Tubb took place on
the following day. This occasioned fresh
unpleasantness, and further excitement of
feeling. Unfortunately Captain Saltren was
on the jury, and he insisted, against all
evidence and reason, in maintaining that the
verdict should be to the effect that Archelaus
Tubb had been murdered by his lordship.
One other juryman agreed with him, but the
others could not go so far. As Saltren
stubbornly refused to yield, the jury was discharged,
and another summoned by the
coroner, which returned “Accidental death,”
but with a rider blaming Macduff for carelessness
in the destruction of the cottage.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was changed in her behaviour to
her father since she had heard Mrs. Saltren’s
story. She had lost faith in him; those
good qualities which she had previously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>recognised in him, she now believed to be
unreal. The man as he was had been disclosed
to her—false, sensual, wanting in
honour. All the good he displayed was the
domino cast over and concealing the mean
and shabby reality. He wore his domino
naturally, with a frank <i>bonhommie</i> which was
the perfection of acting—but then, it was
acting. Arminell was very straightforward,
blunt and sincere, and hated everything
which was not open. Social life she represented
to herself as a school of disguises, a
masquerade in which no one shows as he is,
but dresses in the part he wishes to appear
in. Some men and women are such finished
actors that they forget themselves in their
assumed parts, and such was her father.
Having to occupy the position of a county
magnate, he had come to fit the position
exteriorly, and had accommodated his conscience
to the delusion that he was what he
pretended to be—the wealthy, blameless,
honourable nobleman, against whom not a
stone could be cast. All this was a pretence,
and Arminell was not angry, only her moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>nature revolted at the assumption. Her
high principle and downrightness made her
resent the fraud that had been perpetrated on
herself and the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had on several occasions heard her
father speak in public, and had felt ashamed
because he spoke so badly, but chiefly because
she was convinced that he was repeating,
parrot-like, what had been put into his
mouth by my lady. He pretended to speak
his own thoughts, and he spoke those of his
wife—that was an assumption, and so was his
respectability, so his morality.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had long undervalued her father’s
mental powers, but she had believed in his
rectitude. She thought his virtue was like
that stupid going straightforward that is
found in a farmer’s horse, which will jog
along the road, and go straight, and be asleep
as it goes. But Mrs. Saltren’s story, which
she believed in spite of the improbabilities,
improbabilities she did not stop to consider,
had overthrown the conviction, and she now
saw in her father a man as morally imperfect
as he was intellectually deficient.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Had he been open, and not attempted to
disguise his offence, she might have forgiven
him, but when he assumed the disguise of an
upright God-fearing man, doing his duty, her
strictly truthful nature rose up in indignant
protest.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c005'>“My dear!” exclaimed Lady Lamerton;
“good gracious, what is this I hear? What
have you done? Undertaken to throw open
the grounds and house on Saturday! Why,
Lamerton, how could you? Saturday is the
day on which I proposed to give our garden-party.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Pon my word, Julia, I forgot about your
garden-party!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You promised to make a note of the
day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So I did—not to be from home. But I
forgot when I was asked to allow the place
to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must countermand the order to have
it opened.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That I cannot do. I publicly, at the
meeting, announced that I would allow the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>house and grounds to be overrun on Saturday,
and I cannot withdraw the permission.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Only for this once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not for this once. It is the first Saturday
after the promise was made. You must
postpone your garden-party.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot do that. The invitations have
been sent out. There is no time; ices, the
band, everything, are ordered.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Julia, we must make shift as we
can.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look here, Lamerton, how will it do to
confine our party to the terrace and garden,
and have refreshments in the orangery?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“So be it; that will do very well. The
guests will not object. Tell them there has
been a clash, and they will enjoy the joke.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The public will want to be admitted to
the house by the principal entrance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course. They are to be shown the
state apartments, and the doubtful Van
Dyck.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then—how about our guests? What a
predicament you have got me into. We
cannot receive our guests at the back door.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“No need for that, Julia. Receive in the
garden. The carriages will set down the
guests at the iron gates. Pray heaven we
may have fine weather!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will be very awkward. The footmen
will have to look after the sight-seers, that
they do not poke their umbrellas through the
pictures, or finger the ornaments—and we
shall want them in the garden to attend to
our guests!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It will go all right. I will send Macduff
to arrange. He is a manager.”</p>

<p class='c005'>After a pause, Lady Lamerton said, “I
am glad Hermione will take Arminell under
her wing. You have told Armie to be ready
to start on Monday?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes; I don’t understand the girl,
whether she is in a sulk, or sorry for her
misconduct.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her boxes are being got ready,” said
Lady Lamerton. “There is something in
her manner that is uncomfortable. I have
noticed it as well as you. When I speak
about Lady Hermione, she says nothing,
and leaves the room.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“A plunge in London life will renovate
her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I trust so. She sadly needs renovation.
The caldron of a London season differs from
that of Pelias. The latter rejuvenated those
dipped in it; but the former matures.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you spoken to Arminell about
going out with Jingles the other night?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton shook her head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” said his lordship, “I know it is of
no use. Best say nothing. We must build
our hopes on a diversion of her thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—” Lady Lamerton mused, then
heaved a sigh. “Oh, Lamerton, what a
muddle you have made! How shall we
manage a garden party when we have the
public swarming all about the place? It is a
<i>contretemps</i>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXIX.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>HOW IT WAS CONTRIVED.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Macduff did it. Macduff exerted himself
over it, for Macduff was under a cloud, and
endeavoured to disperse the cloud by the
sunshine of amiability. Besides Macduff
was a manager—would have made a superb
station-master at Rugby, or President of the
French Republic—any other office full of
difficulty and conflicting elements would suit
Macduff. He rose to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'>The day for the garden-party was delightful,
and the park looked its loveliest, except
in early spring and late autumn, when the
buds of some and the fresh green of other
trees were in all shades, or when the first
frosts had touched the foliage with every
hue of gold and copper. These, indeed,
were the times when the park and woods
were in most radiant beauty; but now, with
a soft and luscious haze over the distance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and a brilliant sun streaming light above all,
it was very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c005'>The park and the house were abandoned
to the sight-seers; but the garden, terrace,
and avenue were reserved for the guests.
The orange house, now empty, because the
trees had been brought forth to adorn the
terrace, was decorated and arranged for
refreshments, or for a refuge in the event of
rain.</p>

<p class='c005'>A military band was in attendance, and
four lawn-tennis courts marked out, with
boys in picturesque uniforms stationed about
them, to return the balls that passed beyond
bounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the lodge gate instructions had been
given that the coachmen should deposit the
guests at the garden gates—handsome, scroll
iron gates under an arch of Anglo-Italian
architecture, on the pediment of which were
emblazoned the arms, supporters, and coronet
of the Lamertons. This gate afforded admission
to the garden-terrace, and completely
shut off the more private part of the grounds
from the park. But though the terrace was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>shut off from all intrusion, it was not so
completely closed as to prevent those without
from seeing into it. Between the gate
and the house was a low wall, with a railing
on it. The windows of the state drawing-room
looked out on the terrace, and a glass
door with a flight of stone steps descended
from the entrance hall to the terrace. The
house was of the age of Elizabeth; but one
wing, that containing the state apartments,
had been rebuilt or re-modelled in the reign
of Queen Anne, so that it in no way harmonised
with the rest of the house, though
furnishing within a suite of noble and lofty
apartments, cheerful, and a pleasing contrast
to the somewhat sombre rooms, panelled
with oak, or hung with tapestry in the older
house. Orleigh was not one of those brick
palaces that are found in the Midland and
Eastern counties; but it was commodious,
venerable, and charmingly situated.</p>

<p class='c005'>The arrangements made by Macduff and
sanctioned by my lady, worked harmoniously.
To some of her guests the hostess mentioned
the inconvenience to which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>feared they would be subjected, and left
them to tell the others about it, if they saw
fit.</p>

<p class='c005'>The day was so bright that there was no
occasion to go indoors. Lord and Lady
Lamerton stood at a short distance from the
iron gates, ready to receive their guests,
who, after a first greeting, walked forward
and allowed their hosts to receive the next
batch. They looked at the beds, the
oranges, the view; and those who were
enthusiastic about flowers found their way
into the conservatories. Then the guests
began to coagulate into knots and sets. The
clergy herded together, and the sporting
men graduated towards each other; only the
army men sought out and made themselves
agreeable to the ladies.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where is Arminell?” asked Lady Lamerton,
in an interval between the reception of
guests.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Pon my soul, Julia, I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“She ought to be here—with us. She
puts the obligations of common courtesy from
her as undeserving of attention.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“I will send for her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No; best take no notice. She may appear
presently. Here come the Cribbages.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Lady Lamerton,” exclaimed the
rector’s wife, running up, and in a gushing
manner extending her hand. “How bright
and charming you look, in spite of all your
worries. It is a marvel to me how you bear
up under it all; and to think of the audacity
of Jingles! the ingratitude, the presumption!
So he is turned out of the house, neck and
crop; and yet you look as fresh and smiling
as if nothing had happened. How I do envy
your placidity of temper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, turning to Lord Lamerton. “Really,
my lord, you are an angel of good-nature to
allow the public admission to your beautiful
grounds twice a week, and put yourself and
your guests to annoyance to oblige them. I
heard the particulars from Mrs. Macduff.
Come, Robert”—this to her husband—“you
must not detain our kind hosts. Don’t you
see that the Calwoodleighs are coming? By
the way, dear Lady Lamerton, where is Miss
Inglett? Shall I find her on the terrace?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>What dress is she wearing? There are so
many persons here that I may miss her
among the throng. Which dress is it? The
heliotrope or the amber?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was drawn on by her husband, who
saw that the Calwoodleighs were waiting to
be received. “Come along, Selena,” said
the rector. “I see the archdeacon yonder.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m not going to be hurried, Robert,”
answered Mrs. Cribbage. “I must have another
word presently with my lord. You
may leave me if you like. You are not wont
to be civil to your wife. Besides, I know
why you want to be off. It is very fine pretending
you have something to say to the
archdeacon; I know what is the attraction in
that direction, his niece, Miss Lovat, whom
some think pretty. But I don’t. Go and
prance about the archdeacon and her, if you
like.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Calwoodleighs having gone forward,
Mrs. Cribbage returned to her hosts, and said
to Lord Lamerton:</p>

<p class='c005'>“How good and kind it was of you, my
lord, to put in an appearance at poor Archelaus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Tubb’s funeral. I have no doubt the
family were flattered by the extraordinary
attention, and to be sure, what nasty, spiteful
things have been said about your share in his
death. Now, Robert, I will go with you and
engage Miss Lovat whilst you talk to the
archdeacon.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The arrival of the guests had in the meantime
caused great satisfaction to the sight-seers,
who had discussed and severely criticised
the equipages.</p>

<p class='c005'>The meeting at Patience Kite’s cottage
had been reported in the papers, the speech
by Welsh given as he chose that it should be
read, that of Saltren omitted altogether.
Moreover, the county papers had announced
the throwing open of the grounds on
Saturday, and as this was a day of early
closing, a good many townsfolk, mostly shopmen
and shopgirls, took advantage of the
occasion to come to Orleigh, and see the
place where that notorious Lord Lamerton
lived.</p>

<p class='c005'>They clustered about the garden gates,
passing their comments on the arrivals, mostly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>disparaging, and expressed at times loud
enough to be heard by those discussed.</p>

<p class='c005'>One or two parties arrived in hired conveyances.
“Them’s too poor to keep a
carriage,” was the observation with which
they were saluted. The rector and Mrs. Cribbage
came on foot. “These can’t afford a cab.
Curate and his old housekeeper, won’t they eat!”</p>

<p class='c005'>By far the most stylish and astonishing
was the equipage of Sir Bosanquet Gammon,
the new high sheriff. Sir Bosanquet was a
north-country man who had made a large
fortune as a civil engineer. He was never
able altogether to shake off his native dialect
and to speak as an educated English gentleman.
This was the more singular, as he
asserted that the family was originally De
Gammon, and had Plantagenet blood in it.
His coat-of-arms on carriage and yacht was
a patchwork of quarterings. That Plantagenet
blood and fifty heiresses should not by
their fused gentility have prevented Gammon
from talking with a north-country twang was
something to shake the foundations of Anthropology.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Sir Bosanquet Gammon, being high sheriff,
thought it incumbent on him to make a display,
so he drove to Orleigh in a carriage
with hammercloth, and powdered coachman
and flunkeys.</p>

<p class='c005'>Giraldus Cambrensis, in his “Topography
of Ireland,” says that in Meath, near Foure,
are three lakes, each occupied by a special
kind of fish, and he adds that, although
these lakes are connected, the fish of each
lake keep to themselves, and should they
venture into the lake inhabited by the finny
tribe of another species, they would be so
like fish out of water, that they would die,
unless indeed they precipitately retreated to
their former habitation.</p>

<p class='c005'>It also seemed at Orleigh this day that fish
of three sorts were swimming about in three
several ponds without association and amalgamation.
Within the iron gates and rails
were the red-fleshed salmon, by themselves,
with interests in common, a common mode of
speech, a common code of manner, and a
common culture. Without the railings, yet
within the park, were the common-place fish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>that understood and appreciated jokes which
would have been insipid or vulgar to those
within the railings, also with a common dialect,
a peculiar twang and intonation of voice, and
a common style of thought and cultural tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>Further away, outside the park gates and
enclosure were fish of another quality altogether,
the homely trout—the village rustics,
the miners out of work—also with their
peculiar modes of thought, their dialect, their
prejudices, and their quality of humour, distinct
from the rest and special to themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>How would one of the town fish have felt,
had he been admitted within the gates? How
one of the rustics, if associated with the shop-folk?
Each would have been uneasy, gasping,
and glad to get back from such uncongenial
society into his proper pond once more.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the last of the guests had arrived,
Lord and Lady Lamerton left their reception
post, and mixed with the company. The
lookers-on outside the railings did not at once
disperse. A policeman and a couple of
keepers were on guard. The gates were
closed, but the people insisted on peering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>through the bars and between the rails at the
well-dressed gentle class within, and others
scrambled up on the dwarf wall to obtain a
better view, and were ordered down by the
policeman only to reascend to the vantage
point when his back was turned.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I ain’t doing nothing,” remonstrated one
of those required to descend, “a cat may look
at a king, and I want to see Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come down at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I came here o’ purpose.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You can see the park and the pictures.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, blow the park and pictures. I didn’t
pay two-and-eight return to see them. I
came here to see his lordship. So, Mr. Bobby,
take him my card and compliments. I’m in the
Bespoke Department at Messrs. Skewés.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cannot see him. Come down at
once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I must and will see the nobleman
who has been so wicked, and has caused such
wretchedness, who has tore down widows’
houses, and crushed the ’eads of orphans.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then another man offered a cigar to one
of the keepers.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Look here, old man,” he said. “Point
his lordship out to me. I want to have a
squint at him—a regular Judge Jeffries he
is.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Talk of Bulgarian atrocities,” said another.
“They’re a song to these at Orleigh.
Down with the House of Lords, says I, and
let us have the enfranchisement of the soil.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is all primogeniture does it,” said a
third, “there never ought to be no first-borns.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the innermost pond, meanwhile, the
guests were swimming about and consorting.
Mrs. Cribbage bore down on Lady Lamerton.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do tell me, dear Lady Lamerton, where
is Miss Arminell; I have been searching for
her everywhere. Don’t tell me she is ill.
Though, perhaps, she has had occasion to
feel upset. She really must be somewhere,
but I am so short-sighted I have not been
able to find her. Perhaps she is in a new
dress, with which I am not acquainted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We are going to send her to town; her
aunt, Lady Hermione Woodhead, has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>so kind as to invite her, as we remain at
Orleigh for the time, and do not think of being
in town during the season. It would be
a pity for Arminell not to see the Academy
this year, and hear the Italian opera, and see
some of our friends. So when Lady Hermione
offered it, we accepted gladly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very gladly, I am sure,” said Mrs. Cribbage
with a knowing twinkle in her eye.
“But where is she now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot say, I have not looked for her;
I have been intent on receiving our friends.
Here is Lady Gammon. I must be civil to
her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How propitious the weather is,” said the
high sheriffess, “and how gratified you must
be, my lady, to see so many individuals
about you in the plentitude of enjoyment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There are persons, they belong to a
certain social class, who always use a long
word from the Latin when a short Anglo-Saxon
one would do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a superabundance of ministers, all,
I perceive, of the Established Church; but
really, considering the high sheriff was to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>here, they might have come in hats, instead
of what is vulgarly called wide-awakes. Do
you know, my lady, what it is that I really
want of you? Can you guess what the
favour is that I am going to ask of you?
No—I am sure you cannot. Sir Bosanquet
and I had a discussion together at breakfast
relative to the polarisation of light, and I
said to Sir Bosanquet—” (within parenthesis
be it noted that before the civil engineer was
knighted, his wife always called him hub or
hubby)—“I said to Sir Bosanquet, ‘my dear,
we will refer the matter to her ladyship who
is a very learned lady, and she shall decide.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I!” answered Lady Lamerton, “I
really do not know. It has—that is—I believe
it has—but really I have only the
vaguest idea concerning it; it has to do with
the breaking up of a ray into its prismatic
colours.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew it had to do with prismatic
colours, and had nothing to do with polar
bears. Polar bears are white.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thomson,” said Lady Lamerton aside to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>a footman, “be so good as to send me Miss
Inglett’s maid—to me here, on the terrace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A few minutes later the lady’s maid came
to where my lady was standing; she held a
salver with a three-cornered sealed note on
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, my lady, Thomson said your
ladyship——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” interrupted Lady Lamerton, “what
have you got there?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A note, my lady, Miss Inglett left on her
dressing table for his lordship, before she
went.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Went!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Started, my lady, for town to Lady
Hermione Woodhead’s. She said, my lady,
she would write for me when I was required.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton took the note. It was
addressed to her husband, but she hastily
opened it. It contained these few lines
only—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Papa</span>,</p>

<p class='c005'>&nbsp;&nbsp;“You said it would be best for you and
for my step-mother, and for myself, if I went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>away for some time from Orleigh. I have
gone—but not to Aunt Hermione. You can,
of course, guess who accompanies me, one
whom I trust ere long you will acknowledge
as a son. I will write in a day or two.</p>

<div class='c011'>“Yours ever,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class='c011'>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Arminell.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p class='c010'>Lady Lamerton did not lose her presence
of mind.  “That will do,” she said to the
maid, and went in quest of her husband.
She showed him the letter and said in a low
tone, “No time is to be lost; go instantly,
go yourself to Chillacot, and see if she be
there. If not you can learn where <i>he</i> is.
No one else can go. I will keep the company
amused and occupied. Slip out by the
gate at the end of the avenue and go over
the down, no one will observe you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton nodded, and departed
without a word. Presently up came Mrs.
Cribbage again, “I cannot find Miss Inglett
anywhere,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Mrs. Cribbage,” answered Lady
Lamerton. “How are you likely to when
she is gone to town? Did not I tell you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>that we had accepted Lady Hermione’s kind
invitation?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I did not understand she was gone.
I thought she was going.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Surely you misunderstood me, Mrs.
Cribbage; here comes Sir Bosanquet.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There now,” exclaimed Lady Gammon,
sailing up with a flutter of silk, and a waving
of lace fringe to her parasol. “There I said
so, Sir Bosanquet, polarisation of light has
nothing to do with polar bears. I bought
Plantagenet a box of the prismatical colours
because they are warranted to contain no
deleterious matter in them, should the dear
child take to”—there was no Latinised word
that would suit, or that she knew—“to suck
’em.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh Lady Gammon,” said the hostess,
“I am so vexed that I cannot introduce to
you my step-daughter, but she has been
invited to her aunt’s, Lady Hermione Woodhead,
and there is a Richter concert to-night—selections
from Parzifal, which she ought
not to miss.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXX.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>HOW THE FISH CAME TOGETHER.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Lady Lamerton did her utmost. She was
lively, quite sprightly even. She moved
among her guests with a pleasant smile and
a courteous word for every one. The lawn-tennis
courts were occupied by four sets of
players. A cluster of young men and girls
were at a table blowing soap bubbles, and
finding fund for laughter in the process. A
group of their seniors were making a party
for bowls. Some of the guests stood on the
terrace looking down at the lawn-tennis
players and pretending to take interest in
the games. The majority of those present
wandered about the gardens, shrubberies,
and conservatories.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little hand was thrust into that of Lady
Lamerton, and on looking down she saw
Giles.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mamma, where is papa? I want to go
with him.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“He has had to leave, dear, for a few
minutes; he will return in perhaps half an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I can run after him. Where is
he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cannot follow him, Giles, he is
walking fast, and is about something that
your presence would disturb. Are there no
little boys here for you to play with? Yes,
there are the two Fountaynes. I invited
them expressly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not want to play. I had rather
walk with papa.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But he would wish you to take the little
boys and show them your pony. We cannot,
my dear, always do what we like. We
must bestir ourselves to make our guests
happy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, mamma, I will go with the
Fountaynes as papa wishes it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He let go her hand, and went off. She
looked affectionately after the child for a
moment, and then resumed her duties as
hostess, with an anxious heart but an untroubled
brow.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>From the first moment that our intelligence
dawns, the first lessons impressed on us,
lessons never pretermitted, from which no
holiday gives release, relentlessly and systematically
enforced, are those of self-suppression.
We are not allowed as children even
to express our opinions decidedly, to hate
heartily any person or anything. We are
required, for instance, to say nothing more
forcible than—we are not devoted to our
governess, and not partial to bread-and-butter
pudding. We are instructed either to
keep silence altogether relative to our feelings,
which is best of all, a counsel of perfection;
or if we cannot do that, to give
utterance to them in an inoffensive and unobjectionable
manner. We are taught to
speak of a stupid person as amiable, and of
a disagreeable person as well-intentioned.
Our faces are not suffered to express what
our tongues are not permitted to speak, consequently
the facial muscles are brought into
as complete control as the tongue.</p>

<p class='c005'>Consequently also when we are thoroughly
schooled, we wear masks perpetually and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>always go about with gloved tongues. At
first, in the nursery and in the schoolroom,
there are kicks and sulks, when the mask
and the glove are fitted on, and yet, in time,
we become so habituated to them that we
are incapable of conceiving of life as endurable
without the wearing of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>I know that I have become so accustomed
to a ring on my little finger, that if perchance
I have forgotten it, and gone into society, I
have blushed to the roots of my hair, and
stammered and been distracted, thinking myself
insufficiently clothed, simply because I
had left my ring on the washhand-stand. And
it is the same with our masks and gloves,
we grow to like them, to be uncomfortable
without them, to be afraid to show our faces
or move our tongues when unprotected by
mask and glove.</p>

<p class='c005'>A circus horse becomes so used to the
bearing rein that even when he is allowed to
gallop without one, he runs with arched
neck.</p>

<p class='c005'>We are all harnessed from our cradle, with
bearing reins, not only to give our necks the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>proper curve, but also to prevent us from
taking the bit in our mouths, kicking out,
plunging over the barriers, and deserting the
ring, and the saw-dust, the lights, and the
crack of the manager’s whip.</p>

<p class='c005'>Round and round our ring we go, now at
an amble, then at a canter, and at last at a
gallop, but always under restraint; the only
liberty allowed and taken is now and again
to make our hoofs sound against the barriers,
and to send a little sawdust in the faces of
the lookers-on, who clap hands and laugh or
scream. We dance in our arena to music,
and spin about, and balance ourselves on
precarious bases, take a five-barred gate at a
leap and go over a score of white poles,
dexterously lowered to allow of a leap without
accident. Then we fall lame, and lie
down, and allow a pistol to be exploded in
our ears, and permit ourselves to be carried
out as dead. But whatever jump we make
has been pre-arranged and laboriously
practised, and whatever performance we be
put through has been artificially acquired.
We never snap our bearing rein, never utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>a defiant snort, toss our heads, kick out at
those who would detain us, and dash away
to pastures green and free moorside.</p>

<p class='c005'>Possibly our happiness would be greater
were we to burst away from the perpetual
mill-round, but I know very well what the
result would be. We would rapidly degenerate
on the moorside into uncouth,
shaggy creatures, destitute of gloss and
grace, and forget all our circus manners.</p>

<p class='c005'>That which the grooming and breaking-in
are to a horse, that culture is to a man, a
sacrifice of freedom. The lower classes of
men, the great undisciplined, or imperfectly
disciplined bulk of mankind look on at the
easy motions and trained grace of the higher
classes, with much the same puzzlement as
would a cluster of wild ponies stand and
watch the passing of a cavalcade of elaborately
trained horses. Both would be equally
ignorant of the amount of self-abnegation
and submission to rule which go to give ease
and gloss.</p>

<p class='c005'>According to a Mussulman legend, the
Queen of Sheba had some smack of savagery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>about her; she had goats’ hair on her
ankles. King Solomon heard this by report,
and being desirous of ascertaining the truth,
he had water poured over the pavement of
his court when she came to visit him. As
she approached she raised her skirt, and
Solomon detected the goats’ hair.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are a good many men as well as
women who appear in the best courts nowadays
with hair about their hocks; they have
been insufficiently groomed. But in this
they differ from the Queen of Sheba, that
they persistently show us their hocks, and
even thrust them in our faces. Merciful
powers! how many half-broken, ill-trimmed
cobs I have met with, kicking up their undocked
heels, showing us that they can jump
over poles and overleap hurdles, that they
can balance themselves on chairs, and dance
and rear on their hind legs, and paw the air,
and whinny for applause. We politely pat
our palms, and look all the while, not at their
antics, but at their hocks, not at all impressed
with their silver and spangled trappings, but
very conscious of the hair about their hoofs.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>It is the fashion for moralists to hold up
their hands, and shake their heads, and
declaim against the artificialities, the disguises
of social life, and to say that every
word spoken and look given should be
sincere; that men and women should scorn
concealment and hate subterfuge. But—would
the world be tolerable were it so constituted?
I mean the world of men. Is it
so in the world of nature? Is that above
screens and disguises? Is that ruthlessly
true, and offensively genuine in its operations?
Where is there not manifest a desire
to draw the veil over what is harsh and
unbecoming? The very earth covers her
bald places with verdure, obscures her wounds
and drapes her ragged edges. So the
function of culture is the softening of what is
rough, the screening of what is unseemly,
the disguising of all that may occasion pain.
It is nothing else but charity in its most
graceful form, that spares another at the cost
of self.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have been in a volcanic region where
there were innumerable craters, great and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>small. Those on the plain, hardly rising
above a few feet out of it, showed all their
bare horror, their torn lips, their black throats,
their sides bristling with the angular lava
that had boiled out of their hot and angry
hearts, long ago, but ever showing. They
were perfectly genuine, expressing their true
nature in ugly nakedness. But there were
other volcanoes rising to mountain heights,
and these had mantled themselves in snow,
had choked and smoothed over their clefts,
and hung garlands of silver, and dropped
gauzy veils over their vitreous precipices;
the very craters, the sources of the fire, were
filled to the brim and heaped up to overflow
with unsullied snow, rising white, rounded,
innocent, as a maiden’s bosom. Which was
best? I know which was the pleasantest
to see.</p>

<p class='c005'>So is it with humanity. We are all volcanoes
with fire in our hearts. Some have
broken forth and torn themselves to pieces,
some are in a chronic state of fume, and dribble
lava and splutter cinders perpetually, and
others are exhausted. Surely it is best to hide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>our fires, and drape our savagery, and bury
our snags and dust the white snow over all
that is rugged and gloomy and ungentle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or—to revert to our former illustration, if
we have hair on our heels, which is best, to
expose it, or, like the Queen of Sheba, let
down our skirts over it?</p>

<p class='c005'>When our temper is ruffled, we do not fret
with it those we meet—when our heart is
bitter, we do not spit our gall in the faces of
our friends—when our blood boils in our
veins we are careful to let none of it squirt on
and blister the hand that is extended to us.
A man may smile, and smile, and be a villain—that
is true, but a man or a woman may
smile, and smile, and be exceedingly sorrowful,
may dance and laugh with an aching
heart. Who does not remember Andersen’s
story of the little mermaid, who obtained
from the witch power to shed her squamous
tail at the cost of feeling knives pierce her
soles every footstep she took? And the
little mermaid danced at the prince’s wedding—at
the wedding of the prince whom she
had once held to her heart, and for the love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>of whom she had shed her fish’s tail, and
danced with a rosy face, though every step
was a mortal agony. Do we not love and
venerate the little mermaid, because, instead
of howling or whining, and holding up her
bleeding soles to extract commiseration from
all, she dropped her skirts over them, and
danced and warbled, and flushed as the rose,
so that none supposed she leaped with pain,
and sang to still her heart, and flushed with
stress of anguish? So is it with all who have
gone through the great discipline of culture,
they no more expose their wounds and cry
out for sympathy than they expose deformities.</p>

<p class='c005'>I remember the bridge over the Gave at
Pau, on each side of which through its entire
length sat beggars exhibiting sores and
soliciting alms. But these were men and
women in rags, and those who wear only the
rags of culture do the same, they draw aside
their tatters and expose their wounds to our
shocked eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is not so with such as have gone
through the school and learnt its lessons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>They are not for ever obtruding themselves,
their worries, their distresses on every one
they meet, their own proper self with its torn
veins, and festering grief, and distilling blood
is folded over with silk, and a jewelled
brooch clasps the lace over the swelling,
suffering bosom, and all who see it admire
the jewels and are kept in ignorance of what
is beneath. In the primitive Church the
<i>disciplina arcani</i> was enforced, the doctrine
of holy reserve taught; for there were
certain mysteries of which the faithful were
required to keep the secret; and culture,
modern culture, has also its <i>disciplina arcani</i>,
its doctrine of reserve, a reserve to be observed
on all selfish pains and sorrows, a
mantling over with a cloak of mystery
everything which can jar with the pleasure
and the cheerfulness and the brightness of
the day to others.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, with a heart quivering with apprehension
and racked with grief for Arminell, Lady
Lamerton moved about the terrace with a
placid face, and with her thoughts apparently
engrossed wholly in making her guests at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>home and happy. She insisted on Sir
Bosanquet Gammon and the rector playing
at aunt Sally, whilst Lady Gammon looked
on with a face green with horror. She
brought a garden chair herself to old and
tottery Mrs. Calwoodleigh, who was standing
looking on at her daughter playing lawn
tennis. She found a timid little cluster of
husband and wife and daughters, fresh
arrivals in the neighbourhood, and knowing
no one, and introduced them to a dozen nice
families. She broke up a flirtation with a
young officer, which she thought undesirable,
by sweeping away with her the young lady
into the orchid house to admire a clump of
<i>Dissa grandiflora</i>. She interrupted a political
discussion in the nick of time, before
the parties became angry and personal. She
singled out a little old maid outrageously
dressed, who was prowling about the flowers,
and delighted her by presents of cuttings
and little pots of bulbs, more than she could
carry, but which the gardener was bidden
convey to Miss Bligh’s carriage. She galvanised
into life a drooping cluster of young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and smooth parsons, and set them playing
La Crosse with as many charming girls.
She pointed out the tables where were claret
and champagne cups, strawberries and
cream, to certain thirsty and heavy souls
which had been gravitating sideways in that
direction for some time. She caught an
antiquary, and carried him off to the
end of the garden to show him a Romano-British
stone with ogams nicked at the
angle, which had been discovered used
as a footbridge, and set up by Lord Lamerton
to save it from destruction.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, Mr. Fothergill, I must leave you
to copy the inscription. Lady Gammon is
anxious to have the polarisation of light
explained, and I must take her to the library
for an encyclopædia—fortunately the study
to-day is not invaded by the public.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Behind her back many a remark was made
on her excellence as a hostess, her cheerfulness,
her amiability. Every one liked Lady
Lamerton; they could not fail to do so, she
took such pains to make herself agreeable.
Only Arminell despised her, and despised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>her for those very qualities which won to her
the hearts of her acquaintances. Arminell
thought her lacking in depth and sincerity.
It was true that she was without intensity of
conviction, but that was characteristic of
breadth; it was true that she was unreal,
and that was part of her culture; so to some
folks everything is unreal but Zolaism, the
Morgue, discourtesy, breach of good manners,
the refuse heap. Man is unreal clothed in
skin, the only genuine man is he who has
been excoriated, with every nerve and
muscle and vein exposed; the canvas only
is real, not the Madonna di San Sisto looking
with her ineffably earnest eyes out of it;
lamp-black and treacle and old rags are the
reality, not the Book of Psalm and Song,
printed out of the former on the transubstantiated
latter; catgut and deal and brass
only are real, not the symphony of Beethoven,
not the march from the Kemenate in
“Lohengrin,” played on the instruments
manufactured out of these vulgar materials.
The pelting rain is real, not the gilded evening
cloud that contains the stored moisture;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>in a word, that only is real, and commendable,
and to be observed, which is gross
material, offensive. I know that the sweetness
and fragrance of that old culture which
was but another name, as I have already
said, for charity, is passing away, like the
rising incense, perhaps again to be caught
and scented only in the courts of heaven. I
know that it is in fashion now to be rude and
brusque, and to deny oneself no freedom,
and exercise on oneself no restraint, so as to
be quite natural. But what is that save to
revert to social Adamanism and Bosjesmanism—to
savagery in its basest and nastiest form—to
renounce the form as well as the power of
culture.</p>

<p class='c005'>Phædrus tells in one of his fables of an old
woman who found an empty amphora of old
Falernian wine; she put her nose to the
mouth and snuffed and said, “If you smell so
sweet when void, how sweet you must be
when full.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Well! let us say that half the politeness
and grace and charm of society is unreal.
It is the aroma of the old Falernian. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>much better, no doubt, if the vessel be full of
that most precious old Falernian, that perfect
courtesy of heart which suffereth long and is
kind; vaunteth not itself, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil, believeth all things,
loveth all things, endureth all things. But,
I ask, is not an empty amphora of Falernian
more grateful than one full of asafœtida?</p>

<p class='c005'>The evening light slanted over the park,
making the grass yellow as corn, and casting
purple shadows behind the elms. The front
of the house toward the terrace was glorified,
the plate glass windows gleamed as if rolled
out of sunlight. The terrace was alive with
people in their gayest dresses, in light
summer colours, pink and turquoise, strawberry,
spring green, crimson and cream.
The band was playing, and the scarlet uniforms
of the military formed a brilliant patch
of colour at the end of the terrace against a
bank of yews.</p>

<p class='c005'>Below the terrace was the tennis-court,
reached by a flight of several steps, and
against the wall that upheld the terrace roses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>were trained, and were in masses of flower,
scenting the air.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lawn-tennis ground formed a second
terrace banked up from the park which
sloped away rapidly thence to the winding
river Ore.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the midst of the flower-beds and moving
coloured kaleidoscope of figures on the
gravelled terrace was a fountain and a basin.
In the latter floated water-lilies, and gold fish
darted, and carried off the crumbs cast to
them. The water that leaped out of a
triton’s shell was turned in the evening sun
as it fell, into amethysts.</p>

<p class='c005'>Away, across the valley, stood the little
church with its tower peeping out of limes,
now all alight with the western sun; and
the cock on its top was turned to a bird of
fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hark!” exclaimed the rector, “I hear
our bell. Good heaven! Surely I’ve not
forgotten—I did not know there was to be a
funeral. I did not know any one was ill—in
danger. It is tolling.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the band, which had rested for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>moment and shaken the moisture out of their
wind instruments, and cleared their throats
with iced ale, came to attention as the conductor
rattled his staff on the music-stand,
and beat, one, two, three, four! Then with
a blast and crash and rattle—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Se-e-e the conquer-ing her-er-er-er-er-o comes,</div>

      <div class='line in3'>Be-e-eat the drums.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At that moment, again, a little hand was
thrust into that of Lady Lamerton, and again
she saw her boy, Giles, at her side. He was
looking pale, and was crying.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is the matter, Giles? You are
shivering. Have you taken a chill? Go indoors,
dear.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mamma,” said the boy, “I want papa.
I have shown the Fountayne boys my pony
and the horses, and my goat, and rabbits,
whatever I thought papa would like them
to see, and now I want papa. Where is
papa?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear, you must go indoors. What
is that? In pity—what is going on? Surely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the public are not going to invade the
terrace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Yes—they were.</p>

<p class='c005'>A large party had been shown the state
apartments, had looked at the pictures, tried
the sofas, made jokes over the family portraits,
attempted to finger the china, and then
had assembled at the drawing-room windows
which commanded the terrace and the lawn-tennis
courts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Seeing the ’ouse without the master, is
like ’Amlet with the part of ’Amlet left out,”
observed one of the sight-seers. “I say,
flunkey, point us out the noble lord, and I’ll
tip you a copper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gentlemen and ladies,” said the august
butler, “I must request that you will not
press to the windows. It is time to move
on. There is another party waiting to go
over the house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! but suppose we don’t choose to
move on, Old Heavy? Ain’t the place open
to us? Was any time specified for us to be
trotted out? Show us the statute,” laughed
a lawyer’s clerk.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>However, after some urging and remonstrance,
the throng was got outside the state
drawing-room, into the entrance hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I say, you coves!” shouted the young
man from the bespoke department of Messrs.
Skewés, “Follow me, and I will get you a
sight of his lordship and all the blue-blooded
aristocrats below.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He led the way, and was followed at a run
to the glass door opening upon the steps
that descended to the terrace; the rush was
so sudden that the butler had not time or
thought to interpose.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hark!” called the lawyer’s clerk. “By
George, if the band ain’t doing us the compliment
by anticipation of striking up ‘See
the conquering hero comes!’ which means
us—the British public. Lend a shove,
Tommy, and we’ll be down among them and
have some ices and sherry cobbler too, and
take a squint at the noble lord himself.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A united thrust against the double glass
doors drove them apart, and down the steps,
and out upon the terrace poured the Public.</p>

<p class='c005'>At that same moment the iron gates were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>swung apart, and another party entered
through them—not of the sight-seers, but
villagers in their working clothes and shirt-sleeves.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The conductor of the band looked round,
and what he saw made him hold up his staff.
The music instantly ceased.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also, simultaneously, all talking among the
guests ceased.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also, instantaneously, the sight-seers who
had been jostling one another, and laughing
loudly, and egging one another on, and were
pouring down the steps, halted and ceased to
be heard.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nothing, indeed, was heard but the toll of the
distant bell, and the crunch of the gravel under
the feet of the advancing party of villagers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fish of the three ponds had mixed
for once, and were silent in the presence of
the all-conquering hero to whom all submit—Death.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXXI.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>HOW IT CAME ABOUT.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“I wonder now,” said Mrs. Saltren to herself,
“whatever has made the raspberry jam
so mouldy? Was the fruit wet when it was
picked? I cannot remember. If it was, it
weren’t my fault, but the weather on which
no one can depend. I wanted to send up
some to Tryphœna Welsh, but now I can’t,
unless I spoon off the mould on the top of
one and fill up from the bottom of another.
It is a pity and a waste of confidence and a
sapping of faith when one goes, makes jam,
and spends coals and sugar and a lot of perspiration,
and gets nothing for it but mould
an inch thick. I must send Tryphœna
Welsh something, for if Giles, as he tells me,
has gone to take up with writing for the
papers, he’ll need the help of James, and
there’s no way of getting at men’s hearts but
through their stomachs. It was tiresome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Giles writing to my brother and not saying
a word to me about it. I could have told
him James was not in town, so no need for
him to address a letter to him at Shepherd’s
Bush; he went after seeing us, to stay with
one literary friend and then another, so he
won’t have Giles’ letter till he returns to
town. That accounts for my boy receiving
no answer. Giles never saw him when he
was here, which was tiresome. It is vexing
too about the hams. I’d have sent one up
to James, if they had not been spoiled, along
of the knuckles being outside the bags, so
that the flies walked in as they might at a
house door. I pickled those hams in treacle
and ale and juniper. I made paper bags for
them, and what more could I do? It was
no fault of mine if the hams got spoiled. It
was the fault of the hams being too big for
my paper bags, so that the bone stuck out.
And then the weather—it was encouraging
to the flies. After the raspberry jam and
the hams, one wants comfort. I’ll get a
drop.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But before she had reached the corner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>cupboard, the door opened, and her husband
came in, looking more strange, white, and
wild than ever. He staggered to the table,
rolling in his walk as if he were drunk, and
held to the furniture to stay himself, fearing
to take a step unsupported. His face was
so livid, his eyes so full of something like
terror, that a thrill of fear ran through Mrs.
Saltren—she thought he was mad.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Saltren? Why do you look
at me in that fashion? I was not going to
my cupboard for anything but my knitting.
I said to myself, I will knit a warm jersey
for Giles against the winter, and I put the
pins and the wool in there. Now don’t look
so queer. Are you ill?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne,” he said slowly, then drew a
long breath that sounded hoarsely in his
throat as he inhaled it, “Marianne, you are
avenged.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean? Are you referring
to the hams or the raspberry jam?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne,” he repeated, “the word has
come to pass. The hand has been stretched
forth and has smitten the evil doer. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>mighty is cast out of his seat and laid even
with the dust.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know what you’re a-talking about,
Stephen. I concern myself about common
things, and about prophecy no more than I
do about moonshine. The jams get mouldy
and the hams ain’t fit to eat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did I not tell you, Marianne, of what I
saw and heard that Sabbath day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I gave no heed to it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is fulfilled. The purposes of heaven
fulfil themselves in a wonderful and unexpected
way when we are least awaiting it.
He is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is dead?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lord Lamerton!” Marianne Saltren
started.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How is it that? Where, Stephen, and
when?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is lying dead beneath the cliff.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good heavens! How came that
about?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was cast down by the hand of an
avenging justice. You have been avenged.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>“I—I have nothing to complain of—to
have avenged on Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing of late, but you told me of the
dishonour, of the wrong——”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren uttered a cry of horror.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stephen, for God’s sake!—you do not
mean?—you know, you know that I named
no names.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I knew, Marianne, to whom you referred.
I knew it at once. Then I understood
why you gave your son the Christian
name he bears.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, Stephen, it was not that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Marianne, it was. It all hangs together.
I saw how he, Lord Lamerton, was
constrained to make much of the boy, to
spend money on him, to educate and make a
gentleman of him, and take him into his
house.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Stephen! Stephen! this is all a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, Marianne, it is no mistake. I see it
all as plainly as I saw the angel flying in the
midst of heaven bearing the Everlasting
Gospel in his right hand, which he cast into
the water before me.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“I was talking nonsense. I am—Oh,
Stephen! What did you say?—he—Lord
Lamerton is not dead?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He is dead. He is lying dead on the
path.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Saltren was seized with a fit of
trembling, as if an ague were come over her.
She stared at her husband, terror stricken,
and could not speak. A horrible thought, a
sickening dread, had swept over her, and she
shrank from asking a question which might
receive an answer confirming her half-formulated
fears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The judgment has tarried long, but the
sentence has overtaken the sinner at last.
Now, after all, he has been made to suffer
for what he once did to you. He cast you
down, and with like measure has it been
meted to him. He is cast down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He did nothing to me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are ready to forgive him now, and
to forget the past, because you are a Christian.
But eternal justice never forgets, it waits and
watches, and when least expected, strikes
down.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“Oh, Stephen! What are you thinking of?
You listened to my idle talk. You fancy that
Lord Lamerton was—was the father of Giles,
but he was not. Indeed, indeed he was
not.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was not!” echoed the captain, standing
stiffly with outstretched arms and
clenched fists, a queer ungainly figure, jointless,
as if made of wooden sticks. “You
yourself told me that he was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I named no names. Indeed I never said
he was—why, Stephen, how could he have
been, when you know as well as I do, that
he was out of England for three years at that
time; he was <i>attaché</i> as they call it at the
embassy in—I forget, some German Court,
whilst I was at Orleigh with the dowager
Lady Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The captain stood still, thinking; as one
frozen and fast to the spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Besides,” put in the woman, with a
flicker of her old inordinate vanity and falsehood,
in spite of her present fear, “you
think very bad of me if you suppose I’d have
took up with any one less than a viscount.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>A long silence ensued, in which the tick of
the clock sounded loudly and harshly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne,” he said at last, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is all your fault and stupidity,” said his
wife hastily. “You have no judgment, and
a brain on fire with religious craze. If you
would but behave like an ordinary, sensible
man and think reasonably, you would never
have fallen into this mistake. You had only
to think a moment reasonably, and you’d
know that it was not, and could not be a
man, and he only the honourable, and like
to be no better than a baron, many hundred
miles away at a foreign court, and the postage
then not twopence ha’penny as ’tis now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne,” said Saltren again hoarsely,
and he took a step nearer to her, and
grasped her wrist. “Marianne, answer me,”
Saltren spoke with a wild flicker in his eyes
as though jack-o’-lanterns were dancing over
those deep mysterious pools, “as you will
have to answer at the great day of account—is
Giles <i>not</i> the son of Lord Lamerton?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course not, I never said so. Who
but a fool would suppose he was, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>week’s post and foreign languages between?
He never left—Munich I think
it was, but it may have been Munchausen,
and I never left Orleigh all the three years.
Besides—I never said it was. I named no
names.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now a shudder ran through Saltren, a
convulsive quake, but it was over instantaneously.
Then, with his iron hand he
pressed the woman’s wrist downwards.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kneel,” he said, “kneel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are hurting me, Stephen! let go!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Kneel,” he repeated, “kneel.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He forced her from her feet to her knees,
before him, she was too frightened to disobey;
and her vain efforts to parry reproof,
and lay the blame on him, had been without
success, he had not noticed even the mean
evasions.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne,” he said solemnly, in his
deepest, most tremulous tones. “Tell me—who
was the father of Giles?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That I will not—never—no, I cannot
tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You shall, I will hold you here, with my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>hand clenched, and not let you go—No,
never, not all the coming night, not all next
day, all the night following—for ever, and
ever, until you confess.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She stooped towards the floor, to hide her
face from his searching eyes, with the lambent
flame in them that frightened her.
Then she looked furtively towards the
window, and next to the door, into the back
kitchen, seeking means of escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is in vain for you to try to get away,”
said the captain slowly. “Here I hold you,
and tighten my grasp, till you scream out the
truth. They used to do that in England.
They slipped the hands in iron gloves and
the feet in iron boots, and screwed till the
blood ran out of fingers and foot-ends, and
the criminal told the truth. So will I screw
the truth out of you, out of your hands. You
cannot escape. Was the father of Giles a
nobleman?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was not the highest of all—not a
duke.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was he then?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was silent, and strove to twist her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>hands away. He held both now. He compressed
his clutch. She cried out, “I cannot
bear this.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was his title?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are hurting me, Stephen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Was he a nobleman at all?”</p>

<p class='c005'>With hesitation, and another writhe to get
away—“N—no.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, all that story you told of the
deception practised upon you was a lie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not a lie—it was a joke. James was
not such a fool as you, he took it as such.
But you—”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Stephen Saltren drew his wife to her
feet, and strode to the door, dragging her
with him. She screamed. She supposed
he was about to kill her; but he turned, and
said gloomily, “I will not hurt you, I want
to show you what you have done—with
your <i>joke</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He forced open the door, and drew her
through the garden, out at the wicket gate,
along the path up the coombe. There were
two ways thence to Orleigh Park, one down
the coombe to the main valley and high-road,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and round a shoulder of hill; the other way
by a steep climb up a zig-zag path in the
side of the hill to the top of the crag, thence
over a stretch of some thirty acres of furzy
down into the plantations and so into the
park through them. The tortuous ascent
began at the cottage, Chillacot, but Saltren
drew his wife past the point whence it rose to
where the evening sun cast the black shadow
of the crag or “cleave” across the glen, and
there—lying on broken, fallen stones, with
his hands outstretched, his face to the clear
sky, lay Lord Lamerton, dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Marianne Saltren cowered back, she was
too frightened by what she saw to care to
approach; but her husband’s vice-like grasp
did not relax for all her weeping and entreaties.
He compelled her to come close to
the fallen man.</p>

<p class='c005'>His finger ends buried themselves in her
wrists, and checked her pulse, that her hands
became numb, and tingled.</p>

<p class='c005'>He remained silent, for long, looking at
the dead man, his own face scarcely less
white, his muscles hardly less rigid, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>features as set, and more drawn. There was
no sunlight in the narrow valley where they
stood under the great slate cleave, but above
at the edge of the opposite hill were gorse
bushes so covered with golden bloom that
they seemed to be but one yellow flower,
and on them the evening sun rested lovingly.
Above, ghost-like in the blue sky, was a
filmy disc—the moon, only perceivable from
the deep valley, unseen by those who stood
in the sunlight. The rooks were congregating
in the wood at the bottom of the valley.
That wood was a favourite resort to which
the birds from several rookeries came every
evening before set of sun, and chattered
incessantly, and made as much noise as if
they were members of the House of
Commons discussing Irish matters. The
sound issuing from that wood was strident
like the rattle of a lawn-mower.</p>

<p class='c005'>A blue-bottle fly was buzzing round the
dead man. Saltren saw it, it made him uneasy;
he let go one of his wife’s hands and
with his disengaged hand drew his kerchief
from his throat, a black silk one, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>whisked it to and fro, to drive away the insect.
“I cannot tell,” he said, “heaven
knows. If it had not been for what you said,
for your amusing joke, he might now be
living. I cannot tell. The ways of Providence
are dark. We are but instruments
used, and not knowing for what purpose
used. I cannot tell.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He put the kerchief to his face and
wiped it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was yonder,” he pointed upwards with
his chin, and then whisked his kerchief in the
direction of the top of the cliff. “I was on
the down, and when I least expected it, and at
the moment when I was not thinking of him,
I saw him striding towards me, and when he
came up with me, he was out of breath. I
was standing then at the edge of the cleave.
I was looking down into the coombe at my
house, and I was in a dream. When I saw him,
I did not stir. I would not go to meet him.
I let him come to me. And when I saw him
turn out of his path and cross the down to
me, then I knew the hand out of the clouds
pointed the way, and he followed not knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to what it pointed. He came close to
me, to the very edge of the rock, and I did
not budge one inch. He had been walking
fast, and spoke pantingly, in a strangely
mixed manner, and he asked some question
about Giles. I do not remember what he
asked, but at the sound of his voice and of
that name, then the fire that was in my heart
broke out, and I was blind and mad. My
blood roared in my ears and head, as the sea
roars and beats against the coast in a gale.
Then I shouted out all I knew; I told him
that Giles was his son, and that God would
call him to account for his sins and his injustice
and cruelties; and he was as one
amazed, that neither spoke nor moved till I
raised my hand to strike him on the breast to
rouse him to answer, and then, before ever I
touched him, he stepped back and went
over the cleave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Marianne Saltren uttered a piercing
shriek and tossed, and put her teeth to her
husband’s hand to bite at the fingers and
force them to relax their grasp.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are people coming,” she screamed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“I will tell them all that you killed him.
Let me go. I cannot bear your touch.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You accursed woman, you daughter of
the old father of lies,” said Saltren between
his teeth, and the bubbles formed in his
mouth as he spoke through his teeth, “I
will not let you go till you have told me who
was the father of Giles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly, however, he let go her wrist,
but she had her liberty for a moment only.
He had drawn his black silk neckerchief
round her throat, and twisted the ends about
his fingers under her chin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marianne, I killed him. Yet not I. I
am but the executioner under Providence.
What heaven judges that I carry out. And
now I do not care if I kill you, after I killed
him. I will kill you, I will strangle you, unless
you confess who was the father of
Giles.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He was capable of doing what he threatened.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It were best for you,” he said, “wicked
woman, to suffer here a little pain, than burn
eternally. Confess, or I will send you into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the world beyond.” She was quiet for a
moment, desisting from her useless struggle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will release me if I say?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will do so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He was a wonderfully handsome man
then, a very fine fellow, the handsomest I
ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There were others besides me lost their
hearts to him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hear voices below the house. People
are coming. You will be taken and hung
because you killed him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren did not move a muscle. “Let
them come, and they will find you dead also,
beside him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You cannot judge of what he was by
what he is now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“His name?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again she looked to right and left, in
spite of the grip under her chin, and made a
start to escape, but instantly he tightened
the kerchief and she became red as blood.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“Marianne,” said Saltren. “His name?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He relaxed the pressure. She listened,
no—she heard no voices, only mingled cawing
of rooks and thumping of pulses in her
ears.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you must know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I must.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It was—Samuel Ceely.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXXII.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A PLACE OF REFUGE.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>He thrust her away from him with an exclamation
of disgust. Then he stooped. A
tuft of meadow-sweet grew among the stones
where the dead man lay, and its white
flowers were full of pollen, and the pollen,
shaken from them, had fallen, and formed a
dust over the upturned face.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Saltren drew his black silk kerchief
over the dead man’s brow, and wiped
away the powder, and as he did so was
aware that the blue-bottle had returned; he
heard its drone, he saw its glazed metallic
back, as it flickered about the body. Then
he turned and went away, but had not gone
far before he halted and came back, for he
thought of the insect. That fly teased his
mind, it was as though it buzzed about his
brain, then perched and ran over it, irritating
the nerves with its hasty movement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>many feet, and the tap of its proboscis. He
could not endure the thought of that fly—therefore
he went back, and stood sweeping
with his kerchief up and down over the face
and then the hands, protecting the body
against the blue-bottle.</p>

<p class='c005'>He heard his wife running away, crying
for help. He knew that before long she
would have collected assistants to come to
remove the dead body. They would find
him there; and was it safe for him to be
seen in close proximity to the man he had
killed?</p>

<p class='c005'>He knew that he ought to go. He had a
horror of being there, alone with the corpse.
Again he took a few steps to leave it, but,
looking back over his shoulder, he saw the
blue-bottle settle on the forehead, then run
down along the nose to the lips of the dead
man, and he went back to drive the creature
away once more. Presently he heard voices,
not those now of cawing rooks, but of men.
But he could not stir from the place. He
would be committing a sin, an unpardonable
sin, a sin from which his soul could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>cleanse itself by floods of penitential tears,
were he to allow the blue-bottle to deposit
its eggs between those dead lips. His mind
was unsettled. Now and then only did he
think of himself as endangered, and feel an
impulse to escape; and yet the impulse was
not strong enough to overcome his anxiety
to protect the body. He did not consider
the future, whether he had occasion to fear
for himself, whether he would be put on his
defence.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a flood we find backwaters where
promiscuous matter drifts in circles—straw,
snags of wood, a dead sheep, a broken chair;
so was it in the mind of Stephen Saltren. His
ideas were thrown into confusion; thoughts
and fancies, most varied and incongruous,
jostled each other, without connection. The
discovery that his wife had lied to him in the
matter of the parentage of Giles and the guilt
of Lord Lamerton, following on the excitement
in which he had been through the encounter
with his enemy, had sufficed to
paralyse his judgment, and make his thoughts
swerve about incoherently.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>He was aware that he had committed a
great mistake, he knew that his position was
precarious; but his confidence in his vision,
and the mission with which he was entrusted
remained unshaken, and this confidence justified
to his conscience the crime that he had
committed, if, indeed, he had committed one.
But in the gyration of thoughts in his brain,
only one fact stood out clearly—that a blue-bottle
fly menaced the corpse, and that it was
his duty to drive the insect away.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was engaged on this obligation, when a
hand touched him, and on looking round he
saw Patience Kite.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Captain Saltren,” said the woman, “why
are you here? I saw you both on top of the
cleave, and I do know that he did not fall by
chance. I will not tell of you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked at her with blank eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Others may have seen you besides myself.
You must not be found here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am glad,” said he dreamily, talking to
himself, not to her, “I am glad that I had,
myself, no occasion against him. I thought I
had, but I had not.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Come with me,” said Mrs. Kite, “folks
are near at hand. I hear them.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked wistfully at the dead face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What! Do you want to be taken by the
police?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot—I am held by the blue-bottle.”
In a moment she stooped, snapped her hands
together and caught the fly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Saltren, “I will follow. It
was not I, I am but the miserable instrument.
The hand did it that brought him my way,
that led him to the edge, and that then laid
hold of my arm.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Patience caught him by the shoulder and
urged him away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must not be seen near the body.
Take my advice and be off to Captain Tubb
about some lime, and so establish an alibi.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren shook his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If not, then come along with me. I will
show you a hiding-place no one thinks of.
Folks could not tell how to take it, when they
did find me lying buried under the fallen
chimney; but when I saw it was cracking, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>made off through the dust, and none saw me
escape. At the night-meeting some thought,
when I stood on the table behind you, that I
was a spirit. You can feel my grip on your
arm, that I am in the flesh and hearty. I set
fire to the tumbled thatch. It does good to
scarce folks at times.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She drew Saltren into the wood. From a
vantage point on the other side of the valley
from that of the crag, themselves screened
from sight, they could see a cluster of men
about the dead body of Lord Lamerton, and
Mrs. Saltren gesticulating behind them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I wonder,” said Patience Kite, “whether
that wife of yours be a fool or not? Your
safety, I reckon, depends on her tongue. If
she has sense, she will say she found the dead
lord, as she was going to fetch water. If
she’s a fool, she’ll let out about you. Did any
one see you on the down?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think Macduff went by some time before.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—I saw’n go along. That was some
while afore.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren said nothing. He was less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>concerned about his own safety than Mrs. Kite
supposed. He was intently watching the men
raise the dead body.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is a pity,” pursued Mrs. Kite, “because
if you hadn’t been seen by Mr. Macduff, I
might have sworn you a famous alibi, and
made out you was helping me to move my
furniture. Thomasine also, she’d ha’ sworn
anything in reason to do you a good turn.
What a sad job it was that you didn’t chuck
over Macduff as well. But there—I won’t
blame you. We none of us, as the parson
says, do all those things we ought to do, but
leave undone what we ought. Thomasine
and I’d swear against Mr. Macduff, but I
doubt it would do no good, as Mrs. Macduff
keeps a victoria and drives about in it, and
we don’t, so the judge would have respect to
the witness of Macduff and disregard ours.
And yet they say there is justice and righteousness
in the world!—when our testimony
would not be taken and Macduffs accepted,
along of a victoria.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She caught Saltren’s arm again, and led
him further into the wood, along a path that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>seemed to be no path at all for a man to
walk, but rather a run for a rabbit. The
bushes closed over a mere track in the
moss.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I reckon,” muttered Patience, “there’ll
be a rare fuss made about the death of his
lordship; but how little account was made of
that of young Tubb. That was a cruel loss
to Thomasine and me. My daughter and
he were sweethearts. Captain Tubb was
going to take the boy on as a hand at the
lime quarry; he could not earn twenty
shillings in a trade, so he would get fifteen as
a labourer. Well—he could have married
and kept house on that. Either he and my
girl would have lived with me or with his
father. Macduff and Lord Lamerton spoiled
the chance for me and them. I owe them
both a grudge, and I thank you for paying
off my score on his lordship. Macduff may
wait. In fall I will make a clay figure of
him, and stick pins in it, and give him rheumatic
pains and spasms of the heart. Whatever
parsons and doctors may say, I can do
things which are not to be found in books,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>and there is more learning than is got by
scholarship.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Kite paused and looked round.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’ve not been about in the woods,
creeping on all fours as I have, through the
coppice. I know my way even in the dark.
I can tell it by the feel of the stems of oak.
Where there is moss, that is the side to the
sou’-west wind and rain. The other side is
smooth. So one can get along in the dark.
What a moyle there will be over the death
of his lordship all because he was a lord, and
there was nothing made of the death of
Arkie, because he was nobody. There is no
justice and righteousness in the world, or Mr.
Macduff would be wearing bracelets now and
expecting a hempen necklace. Here we are at
my cottage that he and his lordship tore down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>They emerged suddenly on the glade
where stood the ruins. No one was visible.
It remained as it had been left, save that the
fallen rafters and walls were blackened by
the smoke of the up-flaming thatch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Patience did not tarry at the hovel, but led
the way to the quarry edge.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Do you see here,” she said, “you take
hold of the ivy ropes, and creep along after
me. It is not hard to do when you know
the way. Miss Arminell first led me to the
Owl’s Nest. One Sunday she came here,
and holding the ivy, got along to the cave,
and then let go the rope. I went after her;
and when my house was being pulled down
about my head, then I remembered the
cave, and went to it in the same way. Since
then I have moved most of my things I
want, and Thomasine has helped me. But
she couldn’t come till her foot was better,
along the edge where we shall go. What I
cannot carry we let down from above by a
rope, and I draw them in to me with a
crooked stick. I shall have to pay no ground
rent for that habitation, and I defy Mr.
Macduff to pull the roof down on me. It is
a tidy, comfortable place, in the eye of the
sun. What I shall do in winter I cannot
tell, but it serves me well enough as a
summer house. If I want to bake, I have
my old oven in the back-kitchen. Now lay
hold of the ivy bands and come after me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>I will show you where you can lie hid when
there is danger at Chillacot.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren followed her, and in a few minutes
found himself in the cave. She had hung
an old potato sack half-way down the hollow,
and behind this she had made her bed and
stored her treasures.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No one can visit me whom I do not
choose to receive,” said Mrs. Kite. “If I
should see a face come round the corner, the
way we came, I’d have but to give a thrust,
as that you gave his lordship, and down he
would go. Now I will return. You remain
here. See, I crook the ivy chains over this
prong of rock when I am here. Whatever
you do, mind and do not let the chains fall
away. If you do, you’re a prisoner till I
release you. That is how Miss Arminell
was caught. I’ll run and see what is going
on, and bring you word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The old woman unhooked sufficient
strands of ivy to support herself, and went
lightly and easily along the face of the rock.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren remained standing. He had his
hands linked behind his back, and his head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>projecting. He had not recovered balance
of mind; his thoughts were like hares in
poachers’ gate-nets—entangled, leaping, turning
over, and working themselves, in their
efforts after freedom, into more inextricable
entanglement. But one idea gradually
formed itself distinctly in his mind—the idea
that he had not been wronged by Lord
Lamerton in the way in which he had supposed,
and that, therefore, all personal feeling
against him disappeared. But, in the confusion
of his brain, he carried back this idea
to a period before he discovered that he had
been deceived by his wife into feeling this
grudge, and he justified his action to himself;
he satisfied himself that there could
have been no private resentment in his conduct
to his lordship when he lifted his hand
against him, because twenty minutes later he
discovered that there were no grounds for
entertaining it. This consideration sufficed
to dissipate the first sense of guilt that had
stolen over him. Now he knelt down in the
cave, at its entrance, and thanked heaven
that no taint of personal animosity had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>entered into his motives and marred their
purity. It was true that Lord Lamerton
had thrown Saltren out of employ—he forgot
that. It was true also that, as chairman of
the board of directors of the railway, he had
sought to force him to surrender his house
and plot of land—he forgot that. It was
true that at the time when he confronted
Lord Lamerton, he believed that his domestic
happiness had been destroyed by that
nobleman—he forgot that also. He concluded
that he had put forth his hand, acting
under a divine impulse, and executing, not
personal vengeance, but the sentence of
heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a camel, heavy laden, is crossing the
desert, the notion sometimes occurs to it that
it is over-burdened, that its back is breaking,
and it sullenly lies down on the sand. No
blows will stir it—not even fire applied to its
flanks; but the driver with much fuss goes to
the side of the beast, and pretends to unburden
it of—one straw. And that one straw
he holds under the eye of the camel, which,
satisfied that it has been sensibly relieved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>gets up and shambles on. Our consciences
are as easily satisfied when heavy burdened
as the stupid camel. One straw—nay, the
semblance, the shadow of a straw—taken
from them contents us; we rise, draw a long
breath, shake our sides, and amble on our
way well pleased.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lord Lamerton had been doomed by
heaven for his guilt in the matter of Archelaus
Tubb. Was it not written that he who had
taken the life of another should atone therefor
with his own life? Who was the cause
of the lad’s death? Surely Lord Lamerton,
who had ordered the destruction of the cottage.
If the cottage had been left untouched,
the chimney would not have fallen. Mr.
Macduff was but the agent acting under the
orders of his lordship, and the deepest stain
of blood rested, not on the agent, but on his
instigator and employer. Saltren had been
on the jury when the inquest took place, and
he had then seen clearly where the fault lay,
and who was really guilty in the matter; but
others, with the fear of man in them, had not
received his opinion and consented to it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and so there had been a miscarriage of
justice.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a bell-pull be drawn, it moves a crank,
and the crank tightens a wire, and that wire
acts on a second lever, and this second crank
moves a spring and sets a bell tingling. The
hand that touches the bell-rope is responsible
for the tingling of the bell, however far removed
from it. So was Lord Lamerton responsible
for the death of Archelaus, though he
had not touched the chimney with his own hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren was, moreover, deeply impressed
with the reality of his vision, which had grown
in his mind and taken extraordinary dimensions,
and had assumed distinct outline as
his fancy brooded over it. But it did not
occur to his mind that fancy had deceived him,
for to Saltren, as to all mystics, the internal
imaginings are ever more real than those
sensible presentiments which pass before their
eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now he knelt in the cave, relieved of all
sense of wrong-doing, and thanked heaven
for having called him to vindicate its justice
on the man whom human justice had acquitted.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. James Welsh occupied a small, respectable
house in a row in Shepherd’s Bush. The
house was very new; the smell of plaster
clung about it. Before the row were young
plane trees, surrounded with wire-netting to
protect their tender bark from the pen-knives
and pinching fingers of boys. Far in the dim
future was a prospect of the road becoming
an umbrageous avenue; accordingly, with an
eye to the future, those who had planned and
planted the row entitled it The Avenue.</p>

<p class='c005'>Up this avenue of wretched, coddled saplings
walked Mr. Giles Inglett Saltren, in the
best of spirits, to visit his uncle, the Monday
morning after his arrival in town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now Giles Inglett Saltren was about to begin
his career as a journalist, as a politician,
as a man of letters. He had broken away
from the position which had degraded and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>enslaved him, which had cramped his genius,
and suppressed his generous emotions.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had not, indeed, heard from Welsh since
he had written to him, but youth is sanguine.
He could rely on his uncle finding him work,
and he knew his own abilities were of no ordinary
quality. He had essayed his powers
on several political questions. He had written
articles on the Eastern Embroglio, the Madagascar
Policy of the French Republic, Port
Hamilton, the dispute about the Fisheries,
and Irish dissatisfaction. Very vigorous they
were in style, and pulverising in argumentative
force.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had not sent them to his uncle, but he
brought them with him now in a hand-bag.
He came early to ensure finding Mr. Welsh
at home and to allow time for reading his
articles to him, and discussing the terms on
which he was to be taken upon the staff of
the paper with which his uncle was connected.
He figured to himself the expression of the
face of Welsh changing, as he listened, from
incredulity to pleased surprise and rapt
ecstasy, and the clasp of hands when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>lecture was over, the congratulation on success,
and the liberal offer of remuneration that would
ensue.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was one telling passage on Port
Hamilton which to Jingles’ mind was so finely
turned, so rich and mellow in its eloquence,
that he repeated it twice to himself as he
walked from Shepherd’s Bush station to his
destination.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is really well put,” mused Jingles;
“and I think if it comes under the eye of the
Ministry, that it must materially affect their
policy, and, perhaps, decide the question of
the retention or surrender of the station.
More wonderful things have happened than
that it should lead to my being offered a
colonial appointment. Not that I would
accept a post which was not influential. I
am not going to be shelved as a foreign
consul. I intend to be where I can put my
mark on my times, and mould the destinies
of the people. It would not be surprising
were the Conservative Government to endeavour
to silence me by the offer of some
governorship which would take me from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>home, and corner me where my influence
would be powerless. But I intend to keep
my eyes open. I am not one of the men
who submit to suppression. Ah! here is
Uncle James’ door.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He opened the little iron gate. A servant
was on the steps, kneeling and scrubbing the
threshold. She had managed to kneel on
her apron, and tear it out of the gathers.
Her slippers exposed a split over the toe,
showing stocking, and the stocking was
split over the heel, showing skin. She put
her scrubbing-brush to her head to smooth
the hair that had fallen forward, over the
fringe.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is Mr. Welsh at home?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes’ir. Your card, please?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked at her fingers; they were wet,
so she put them beneath her apron, and
extended her hand thus covered to receive
the card, and nipped it through the integument
of coarse linen, then turned and went
in, leaving Saltren on the doorstep with the
bucket. The soap she had prudently removed
within, lest, while she was presenting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the card, he might make off with the square.
She was up to the dodges of such chaps.
So, also, she shut the door behind her, lest
he should make off with an overcoat or
umbrella. A servant cannot be too careful
in the suburbs of London. Presently she
returned, re-opened the door, and asked
Saltren to kindly step into the master’s
study.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. James Welsh was just engaged in unfolding
his morning’s paper preparatory to
reading, or, rather, skimming it, when Jingles
entered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hallo, young shaver!” exclaimed the
uncle, laying aside the newspaper somewhat
reluctantly. “This is sharp work, dropping
in on me before I have had time allowed me
to answer your letter. I only came home
last night. It is like crossing the frontier
simultaneously with declaration of war. If
you had waited for my answer you would
have saved yourself trouble and the cost of
your ticket.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There were reasons which made it
necessary for me to leave at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“My dear boy, reasons are like eggs in a
recipe for a pudding. The pudding is best
with them; but it is good without. You
wanted to come, and you enrich your coming
with reasons. That is the sense of it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, Uncle James, I have long felt a
decided vocation for a political and literary
life, and I have long chafed at the restraints——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Young shaver, in the ministerial world—I
mean the world of ministers of religion—there
are also calls; but, curiously enough,
only such are listened to when the call is
from a salary of fifty to a hundred and fifty.
I never yet heard of a pastor who listened to
a call to leave one of a hundred for one of
half that amount. But they jump like frogs
when the call is t’other way. You should
have learned wisdom from those apostles of
light. You have, I fear, thrown up a lucrative
situation for nothing. Like the dog in
the fable dropped the piece of meat to bite
at a shadow.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have no doubt,” said Jingles gravely,
“that at first I shall not earn much; but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>have some money laid by which will serve
my necessities till I have made myself a
name, and got an assured income.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Made yourself a name! That is what
no journalist ever does. Got an assured
income! That comes late. You have not
been through the mill.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have in my bag some articles I have
touched off, leaders on important matters, of
absorbing interest to the public.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Port Hamilton.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The public don’t care a snap about that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Eastern Question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“About which you know nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Irish Land Question.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“On which you are incompetent to form
an opinion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you look at my articles?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t say. I can tell what they are
like without your opening the bag. I know
exactly the style of these schoolboy productions.
If you particularly desire it, I will
run my eye over them; but I tell you beforehand,
they are good for nought. Mind you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>I don’t expect that a writer of a leader knows
any more of his subject than do you; but he
does know how to affect a knowledge he
does not possess, and disguise his ignorance;
and he has a certain style that belongs to the
business. It is with journalism as with
acting. An amateur proclaims himself in
every sentence. The ass’s ears project from
under the lion’s skin. There are little tricks
of the trade, a margin for gag, that must be
employed and utilised, and only a professional
is at his ease, and has the familiar tricks at
his disposal, and gag at the end of his tongue.
Can you manage shorthand?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shorthand! No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pity that. I might have got you some
reporting jobs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I do not want reporting jobs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you will get nothing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles was rather offended than cast
down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I see what it is, Uncle Welsh,” he said in
a tone of irritation, “you journalists are a
close corporation, and you will not admit an
intruder. You are jealous of an invasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>within your circle, just as a parcel of commercials
resent the entry of any but a
commissioned bagman into their coffee-room.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not a bit; but we do object to a raw
bumpkin who has not gone through his
apprenticeship giving himself airs, and pretending
to an equality with us who have
drudged at the trade till we have mastered
its technicalities.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I presume that a good education and
brains qualify a man to write.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not necessarily—certainly not to write
leaders. I dare say we might hand over to
you the reviewing of children’s books. That
would come within your range.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is an insult to offer such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed! You know little of literature or
you would not say so. Formerly, when
education was scarce, there were but a few
writers, and they were well paid. Now
education is universal, and every one who
can handle a pen thinks he can write, even if
he be imperfectly acquainted with spelling.
Education now is as common, as general, as
pocket-handkerchiefs. Both were luxuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>fifty years ago. Literature is glutted with
aspirants; brain is as common as æsthetic
colours, as embroidered sunflowers, and
Japanese lacquer. What is rare is muscle.
Learn some mechanical art, and you will find
biceps pays better than brain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know very well I have not the health
to adopt the trade of an artisan.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then become a preacher; and here let
me give you advice. If you want to become
a popular preacher, and a power in the pulpit
or on the platform, tear down. It is thankless
work to build up; that takes time,
demands patience, and does not command
immediate popularity and ready applause.
You appeal to no passion when constructive.
Passion is your ready assistant in destruction.
Every man has so much of the savage in
him that he likes the war-path and the taste
of blood. You appeal to what you know is
in all, when you give a war-whoop, and
brandish a tomahawk. There is some
picturesqueness and a sense of power, in
whooping and whirling the axe; there is
only prose in smoking calumets of peace.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“I have no fancy for the pulpit; but I
should like to become a political speaker.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“We can try you at some village meeting;
but the pay is not much. Take my advice
and return to Orleigh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is impossible. I have burnt my
ships. I can never recross the threshold of
the house till I am recognised.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What—as a literary lion? As a stump
orator?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, uncle, as Lord Lamerton’s son.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As—as his—what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. James Welsh burst into a fit of laughter,
and when he was exhausted, exploded, in
spite of exhaustion, into a second peal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles maintained his gravity. His brow
contracted. He folded his arms across his
breast, and stood sternly waiting till this
unseemly ebullition of merriment had subsided,
in the attitude in which Napoleon
appears in Horace Vernet’s celebrated picture,
on Saint Helena, looking at the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must excuse me,” said he at last,
“if I say that this is not the way in which I
expected to be received. First you scoff at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>my honourable ambition to be a man of
letters, and then you explode into indecent
laughter when I mention the fact of my
parentage with which you are perfectly
familiar, though it is not known to the world
at large.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By Jove, Giles, I did not suppose you
were such a fool.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I may say, Giles, that I do not understand
you. Do you mean seriously to assure me
that you give credence to that cock-and-bull
tale?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle Welsh, I believe my mother’s
word.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Far be it from me to say anything to a
son disrespectful of his mother; and in this
case I merely point out to you the richness
and exuberance of your mother’s fancy.
Penelope embroidered by day, and by night
unpicked her day-work. My dear boy, it is,
perhaps, a matter of regret that my sister
contents herself with embroidery, and does
not complement her work by unpicking the
fantastic and highly-coloured figures that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>needle, her tongue, has elaborated. She is
like a magic-lantern projecting pictures upon
smoke, sheets, or blank walls, making those
surfaces alive with forms and faces. You
really would suppose that the man in bed was
actually swallowing the rats that ran into his
mouth, and that Blue Beard in very truth
rolled his eyes and cut off his wife’s head, and
that the cabbage was converted into Snip the
Tailor. But, my dear nephew, they are
phantasms. Go up to them, touch, observe,
there is only smoke or whited wall. I have
the highest respect for my sister’s genius. I
bow before her imagination, and adore it; but
remember what Paley said of the imagination—that
it is the fertile mother of error. My
good sister’s delusive faculty seems to have
become mamma to an extravagant blunder,
which you are lovingly nursing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you place no reliance on my mother’s
account?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Wait a moment.” Mr. Welsh went to
the bookcase. “Here is a peerage. Turn
up ‘Lamerton, Baron,’ and see where his
lordship was at that time that you were begun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>to be thought about. He was not in England—had
not been there for two or three years.
I knew that as well as the author of the peerage,
perhaps better; for I was at Orleigh at
that time, a fact my sister Marianne forgot
when she exhibited to me her magic-lantern
slides. I was not then what I am now. I
was then thankful for a bit of literary work,
and did not turn up my nose at reviewing
children’s books. I was as glad then to get a
chance of putting pen to paper as I now am
of getting a holiday from pen and paper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And,” said Jingles, somewhat staggered
by the evidence of the peerage, “you mean
to tell me that my mother said—what—what—what
was false?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Young shaver,” said Mr. Welsh, “I read
‘Herodotus’ in Bohn’s translation. I don’t
even know the letters of the Greek alphabet.
I read for professional purposes. I observe
that when the father of history comes to a
delicate and disputed question, he passes it
over with the remark, ‘I prefer not to express
my own opinion thereon.’ When you ask me
whether what your mother said was true or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>lie, I answer with Herodotus, ‘I prefer not
to express my own opinion thereon.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles Inglett looked down on the carpet.
His lips quivered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Young shaver,” pursued Mr. Welsh,
cheerily, rubbing his hands together, and
taking up his newspaper, as a hint to his
nephew to be gone, “you had best return to
your inn, and begin to pull out the threads of
that elaborate and gorgeous piece of Gobelin
your mother has furnished you with. Believe
me, under the coloured worsted and floss silk,
you will come on very vulgar canvas. It is
a sad pity that you should have learned that
you are not the son of Stephen Saltren. You
might well have been left to share the
common belief. Perhaps it was inevitable
that you should discover the flaw in your
nativity. Some women cannot hold their
tongues. I am not sure that the Babylonians
acted unwisely when on the occasion of their
revolt against Darius, they strangled every
woman in the city except their cooks, for,
they argued, men can get along without the
sex in every other capacity.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The young man was profoundly disturbed.
He looked up, and said in a voice that expressed
his emotion—</p>

<p class='c005'>“Uncle, do not jest with me in this matter.
To me it is one of deadly earnest. I entreat
you speak the truth, for—good heavens! If
I am not what I supposed myself to be, I
have made a terrible mistake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are no more a son of Lord Lamerton
than I am. Marianne—I mean, your
mother—thinks I am ignorant of the real facts,
but I never was, though I said nothing at
the time or after.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you know who my father was.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I do—but I am not disposed to tell
you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I insist on knowing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You ought never to have been told that
you were not what you and the world supposed.
Now don’t attempt to lift the embroidered
veil your good mother has cast
over the mystery. The veil is handsomer
than what it conceals.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But—I have acted on the supposition
that I was the son of Lord Lamerton.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“I know you have, and more fool you.
You have left your situation as tutor in his
house and a respectable income.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have done more. I have persuaded
Miss Inglett to run away with me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have—what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh dropped his hands and the
paper; he stood for a moment in blank
amazement. Then the blood rushed into
his brow, and his hands clenched.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have—you dare not repeat those
words.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is true. I supposed she was my
sister.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You dirty little blackguard!” cried
Welsh, losing all control over himself and his
tongue; he sprang towards his nephew,
brandishing the newspaper. “I will horsewhip
you with the only weapon I have, the
<i>Daily News!</i> You coxcomb! You infamous
snob! I’m ashamed to acknowledge
you as my sister’s child.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I know that I have made a terrible mistake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mistake is not the word for it. A more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>detestable, outrageous, caddish act, I could
not conceive. Good gracious! I would like
to kick you round my table, kick you down
the hall, kick you out at my door, down the
steps, send you flying along the avenue from
tree to tree, and a kick at each. Do you
not see, you scoundrel, what you have done?—cast
an indelible slur upon the girl’s
character. Mistake—mistake, indeed! Of
all snobbery! Mistake! Get out of my
house this instant. You pollute the atmosphere,
you. You a son of my lord!
You, who have not a drop of honourable
blood in your veins, not a spark of proper
feeling in your heart, not the smallest grain
of gentlemanly, let alone noble sentiment in
your whole nature—you contemptible bastard
of Sam Ceely.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Giles Inglett Saltren was so completely
thrown off his balance by Welsh’s repudiations
of the story of his parentage, that he
did not resent, he hardly heard the burst of
indignation that escaped his uncle; or, if he
heard it, his mind was too preoccupied to
follow his words, and measure their force,
and take umbrage at their grossness. He
was overpowered with dismay. What had
he done? He could not even realise the extent
of the evil he had wrought, nor measure
the depth of his own baseness.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Mr. Welsh was not a man to leave
him without having spread out the mass of
his misdeeds before him, and held his head
down over it, and indicated its most salient
features.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You abominable little snob!” he exclaimed.
“Have you forgotten what has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>been done for you? If his lordship had not
taken you from the hard form on which you
polished the seat of your corduroys, and set
you in an easy chair, you’d have nice callosities
now. Probably you would not have
been alive at all had he not sent you to the
South of France.” Mr. Welsh became
sarcastic. “No doubt you owe his lordship
a grudge because he didn’t let you go at once
to kingdom come instead of detaining you
here in this Vale of Tears. Mind you, Giles—there
is no escape from this fact, that you
owe your life to him. To him also you owe
your education. To him you owe it that,
supposing you had lived, you are not now a
horny-handed ploughboy, that you know how
to use a pocket-handkerchief, and don’t put
your knife in your mouth.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh thrust his hands into his
pockets, and stood with legs apart looking
scornfully at his nephew.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pray, Mr. Giles Inglett, how would you
like to go back to potato pasty and cold
boiled junk of bacon? To an early dinner,
and swipes instead of claret? To getting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>your clothes at a slop-shop, instead of being
fitted by a tailor? To being without books
and magazines and reviews? Are you
aware that you have earned not one of the
luxuries or even comforts of civilised life?
That they have come to you undeserved as
does free Grace? Upon my word, you
make my blood splutter! Shall I tell you
what would have been the end of you had
not Lord Lamerton come to the rescue?
After you were ill you would have been
cared for, or not cared for, after the fashion
of common folk’s children, and your mother’s
haphazard way of doing everything, allowed
to get your feet wet, and stand in draughts,
neglected one day, coddled the next, till
your weak lungs gave way, and rapid consumption
set in. Shall I tell you what would
have been the course of Act II? Then you
would have been mewed up in that dismal
back bedroom at Chillacot, with the ultramarine
wash on the walls, and the snipped,
emerald-green, silver-paper fly trap suspended
in the middle of the room, and the blistered
mirror, and the window looking out at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>dripping rock, ugh! There you would have
lain and coughed; and when an attempt was
made to light the fire, the smoke would have
refused to try the road up the chimney, and
preferred that to your lungs; and when the
window was opened to let the smoke out it
would have let in the smell of the pigstye.
When you wanted a book to enliven you,
you would have been given Baxter’s ‘Saints’
Rest’ or a Methodist Missionary Magazine,
and death itself would have been welcome as
an escape from such literature. You would
have needed wine, and not had it; cod-liver
oil, and not had it; grapes, and not had
them; calves’ foot jelly, and had to do without.
You would have been given thin gruel,
and fried india-rubber, that playfully considered
itself rump steak, much as you
consider yourself a nobleman, and leaden
dough, greasy bacon, and lukewarm bad tea.
Your bed would have been lumpy, and made
occasionally, and your sheets changed now
and then, and your pillow-case assuming the
adhesiveness to your cheek of postage
stamps; and there would have been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>draught like a mill-race pouring in through
that gap—I know it—under the door. When
you wanted to sleep by day, your mother
would be scouring pans in the back kitchen
underneath, and when so inclined at night,
your father, on the other side of the partition,
would be snoring like John Willett.
As you grew weaker, and more unable to
endure worry, in would have come the captain,
to exhort and expound, and stir and
whip up your weary soul into a caper of
screaming terror. You would have longed
for death as an escape from the smells and
the smoke, and the crude blue, and the
draught, and the knots in your mattress, and
the Missionary Magazines, and the pigs in
the yard, and the benzoline lamp.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Welsh stooped and picked up his
newspaper, which lay crumpled on the floor.
He smoothed it, and folded it on the table.
Then he looked hard at his nephew. Giles
remained motionless, with eyes on the
carpet; his brow was troubled and his lips
trembling. He was very pale.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is how you would have ended as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>boy of seventeen,” pursued Mr. Welsh, remorselessly,
mercilessly. “Your life you owe to
Lord Lamerton, your mind has been expanded
and enriched by him. Had he not sent you to
college what would have been the range of
your ideas? What would you have known
of Shakespeare, Thackeray, Pope, Goethe
and Dante? What appreciation of art?
You would have been as incapable of judging
between a good painting and a daub, of
discriminating between Tannhauser and
Sankey and Moody, as any chawbacon.
What I have learned, I have learned with
labour; I had no masters, no hand to help
me over the stile. I wish I had had your advantages,
but no Lord Lamerton took me
up. I had not that luck. I have had to
fight my own way. I daresay you think it
inconsistent in me to take the part of his
lordship against my own nephew, but that is
because your conscience is disordered. I
fight him tooth and nail, because he is an
aristocrat, and I a democrat. It is my business
to attack the Tories and the landed
interest and the House of Lords. I am a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>politician, and in politics all is fair; but we
are now in another region altogether, in that
of common honesty, and domestic relations;
I look on my lord, not as a nobleman, but as
a father, and a kind-hearted man who has
done much for you; and I am able to take
the gauge of your conduct accordingly. You
have behaved infamously towards your
benefactor, you have hurt him where he is
most sensitive—hitting, you contemptible
little coward, below the belt. You have
stained the pure name of his only daughter,
tarnished the honour of an irreproachable
house. Who will believe that the girl ran
away with you, because she supposed that
you were her brother? Everyone knows
that you are nothing of the kind. Should it
leak out that you are not Captain Saltren’s
son, how will it mend matters if it be shown
that you are the bastard brat of old blear-eyed,
one-handed, limping Samuel Ceely?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Giles winced, he raised both his hands,
half beseechingly, half as if to protect himself
from the words which struck him as blows.
It was a convulsive, not a purposed movement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Also he looked up for a moment, and
attempted to speak, but said nothing, the
words died away in his throat. Then his
head fell again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You say you have saved some money,”
Welsh went on; “whose money? That
which Lord Lamerton gave you. How
many hundreds of pounds do you suppose
you have cost him? In sending you to
Bordighera, in doctors’ bills, in school and
college accounts? You swaggered at Oxford
as a gentleman, and Lord Lamerton paid for
it. He furnished your rooms in college, paid
your battels. You invited your friends to
breakfasts and wines, and he paid for them.
Who but he put the clothes on your back,
hung the pictures on your walls, fitted neat
boots on your feet, and supplied you with
that silk pocket-handkerchief you are now
using to wipe the shame drops off your brow
with? And—in return for all this, you stab
him to the heart and blast the fair name of
his child! Good heavens! I feel as uncomfortable
in your presence as would Mr.
Gladstone in a lodge of Primrose Dames on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>St. Benjamin’s day. But there!—enough
about your despicable self. It is high time
something were done about Miss Inglett.
I’ll go with you. What a nuisance it is that
Tryphœna is just now without a cook. I’ll
bring the girl here, nevertheless, if she has
nowhere else to go to; or I will run down
with her myself to Orleigh, or I’ll take her to
any relation she may have in town. You
come with me, you mean little cad, as far as
your inn, or lodgings, or where the deuce
you are, and leave me there. Don’t show
your pasty face again. We have seen already
too much of you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He rang the bell, and the maid-of-all-work
appeared.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Susan, turn, or take off your apron, and
run and fetch me a hansom.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Please, sir, an’ if I don’t come on an
’ansom?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then a cab. Come, sharp!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He said no more. He was agitated, because
very angry. He went out for his hat
and gloves, and an umbrella, opened the
latter and refolded it; then he discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>that he was in a shabby morning coat, so he
changed it upstairs, and put on his boots in
the hall, and then returned for his newspaper.</p>

<p class='c005'>By this time Susan had arrived, seated in
a four-wheeler. She had not encountered a
hansom.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go on,” said Welsh to his nephew, “I’ll
follow.” He took his newspaper from the
table, and brought it with him to the cab.</p>

<p class='c005'>The direction was given to the driver, and
the vehicle started. Welsh would not speak
another word to Giles. He threw himself
back with a grunt in the cab and began to
read his paper.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jingles looked dreamily forth from the
window on his side. The cab was being
driven along Gold Hawk Road; there was
not much traffic in it that morning; a coal-cart,
a Shepherd’s Bush omnibus were passed.
The cabman drew up, and swore at an old
lady who in crossing the road had dropped a
parcel of tracts, which scattered in all directions,
and who returned almost under the feet
of the horse to recover some of the papers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Mr. James Welsh uttered an exclamation.
Saltren did not notice it, he was in a stunned
condition, unable to take observation of anything,
unable to do more than reiterate in his
mind, “I have made a mistake—a fatal
mistake!” He was unable even to consider
in what way it could be rectified, if capable
of rectification. He was not in a condition
to weigh his uncle’s proposals what to do
with Arminell. He did not even feel his
uncle’s rude remarks, they passed over him
without producing an impression, so deadened
were his faculties by the consternation in
which he was. His brain was like a sewing-machine
in full operation, with a needle in it,
stab—stab—stabbing, and always carrying
the same thread, “I have made a mistake—a
fatal mistake!” and making therewith a
lock stitch incapable of unravelment, that went
round and round both heart and brain, and
bound them together.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good God!” exclaimed Welsh, and let
drop his paper on his lap. Then he turned,
“Giles!” he shouted in his nephew’s ear.
“Confound the fellow, are you asleep? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>did think I had heard the worst, but there is
worse behind! Lord—this is awful! Giles—you
fool—look at the paper.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man took the sheet mechanically.
The fly jolted, and he could not read.
He laid the paper down. “My eyes are
dazzled,” he said, “I cannot make out the
print. Besides, I am indifferent to news.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You must not be indifferent. The news
concerns you particularly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t care about politics,” said Giles
irritably, “I am worried, crushed. I have
made a mistake—an awful, a fatal mistake.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This is not about politics at all,” shouted
his uncle. “Lord! How shall I break the
tidings to Miss Inglett? I wish I had brought
my wife. Women do these things better than
men. But, as we have no cook, Tryphœna
is engaged this morning in the kitchen, up to
her ears, above her ears, judging from the
condition of the top of her head, in work—I
must do it. I hope that Miss Inglett has not
seen a newspaper this morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well—then—what is it?” asked young
Saltren impatiently.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“What is it? Just this,” answered Welsh
grimly and with vehemence, “Lord Lamerton
is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dead!” Giles Saltren was frozen with
horror.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes—dead. Found dead near Chillacot,
fallen down the cliff whilst on his way to see
your father. Of course there are suspicions
of foul play. Nothing as yet certain.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Found dead!” The young man gasped
for breath. The muscles of his chest contracted
and a pain as though a bayonet had
stabbed him shot through his heart. He was
suffocating, he gasped for breath. The windows
of the cab began to spin round him, the
back of the cab with the cushions swung round
to the front, and the front lights went behind,
and the side windows rose and hung over his
head, then revolved and were beneath his
feet. Mr. Welsh let down the glass near the
young man, as he saw the condition into which
he was falling, and that he was incapable of
doing this for himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said his uncle, “dead—that is what
has come on us now, and there is mischief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>behind. That mad, fanatical fool, the captain—I
should not wonder if he were involved in
it, with his visions, and trumpets, and vials,
and book of the Gilded Clique. He ought to
have been locked up long ago. He took
everything in solemn earnest; he believed
in Marianne’s rodomontade; he swallowed
her lies whole. As far as I can guess this is
what happened. Lord Lamerton discovered
that Miss Inglett was gone, gone with you,
and without a word to any one went to Chillacot
over the down to make inquiries of the
captain about the fugitives. How he came to
fall over the cliff on his way, God knows!
But of this I am very certain, that it was you,
Giles, who sent him on the road that led to
death. He would not have gone to Chillacot
had he not had need to go there to inquire
after you. So now, Giles, what do you think
of yourself—eh?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Young Saltren covered his face with his
hands, and sank fainting into the bottom of
the cab.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Arminell had awoke to the fact that she
had made a mistake before that conviction
had been brought home to the mind of
Jingles; but she entertained not the shadow
of a suspicion how radical that mistake was.</p>

<p class='c005'>She became conscious that she had put
herself in a false position almost as soon as
she had taken the false step. At the first
large station the guard had been obtrusively
obliging, and a little familiar. He had
allowed her to see that he regarded her and
Giles as a young couple starting on their
honeymoon tour; that he took a friendly
interest in them, and he assured them he
would allow no one to invade their compartment.
He looked in on them half-way to
know how they were getting on; whether
she would desire refreshments to be brought
her to the carriage; whether she would like
to have the blinds drawn down.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Arrived in town, they went to a quiet
private hotel in Bloomsbury, mostly frequented
by literary persons consulting the
library of the British Museum. Jingles had
not been there before. He knew of the hotel
only by repute.</p>

<p class='c005'>The landlady, an eminently respectable
person, hesitated at first about receiving the
young people. She did not understand the
relation in which they stood to each other,
and she looked inquisitively at Arminell’s left
hand. There was not a trace of family likeness
that she could discover in their faces,
when young Saltren explained that they were
brother and sister. A further explanation
was necessary when he gave his name as
Saltren, and hers as Inglett. Then he regretted
that he had not gone to a large hotel,
where no questions would have been asked.
He had considered his pocket, and Arminell’s
wishes. He could not afford a heavy expense,
and she shrank from publicity.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next morning Arminell woke with a sense
of depression she could not shake off. As
she dressed, the tears of mortification rose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>into her eyes. She was vexed with herself
and vexed with Jingles. She knew that
what she had done must wound her father,
and compromise herself, at all events, for a
while. She had taken the step in a fit of
pique at her father’s desire to get rid of her,
and of romantic enthusiasm, to force him to
acknowledge Jingles. She had felt convinced
that in no other way could he be induced to
do this. She entertained no particular admiration
for young Saltren, no great affection
for him, only a girlish eagerness to see a misunderstood
and ill-used man put in his proper
place and acknowledged by the world. When
she met Jingles at breakfast in the coffee-room,
there was mutual restraint between
them of which both were conscious; and in
Arminell’s heart a little welling up of wrath
against him. She knew that the feeling was
ungenerous. He was less to blame than
herself—that is, she had proposed the elopement;
but then he was older than herself,
and as a man ought to have pointed out the
impropriety of the proposal. Now it was
too late. The die was cast which must mould
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>the rest of her life, and of what nature that
die was she could not yet tell.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sunday passed quietly. Arminell remained
for the most part in her own room,
and young Saltren also kept secluded, going
through, recopying, and improving his article
on Port Hamilton, which he regarded as his
masterpiece.</p>

<p class='c005'>On Monday, at breakfast, Saltren told her
that he would go at once, early in the day, to
consult his uncle, and that then they would
go together in search of suitable lodgings.
The looking out for lodgings could be done
in the afternoon, as their nature would be determined
by the amount of income on which
Saltren could reckon.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose,” he said, “that my uncle can
help me into getting the composition of a
leader every alternate day as a beginning,
and if I get five guineas for a leader, that
will make fifteen in the week. Then, I suppose,
I can do reviewing, and write for
magazines, and make about thirty pounds a
week, that will be, say fifteen hundred a year,
as a beginning. I have reckoned the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>as one of fifty instead of fifty-two weeks, because
I shall have to allow myself a short
holiday. On fifteen hundred a year we ought
to have a nice villa residence, with garden
and conservatories. What do you say to a
Queen Anne house at Turnham Green? I,
myself, rather incline to Chislehurst.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When he was gone, Arminell, left to herself,
had returned to her bedroom, to find it not
ready for her. So she went downstairs
again, and sat by the window in the coffee-room,
looking into the street through the
wire-gauze blind, not thinking of and interested
in what passed in the street, but turning in
mind to Orleigh, to her pretty chamber there;
to the breakfast-room, with the windows to
the east, and the sun flooding it; to the table
with its silver, and flowers, and porcelain.
How small everything in this inn was, and
how lacking in freshness and grace!</p>

<p class='c005'>Her father’s cheery face had been a feature
at the meal, as was also her step-mother,
fresh, gentle, pale, and dove-like in movement
and tone. She remembered these
things now that she had cast them from her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and found that they had been pleasant, and
were not to be recalled without a beating of
the pulse, and a rising in the throat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two gentlemen were at breakfast at a
table near her, and were eating eggs—London
eggs—and the savour of eggs, especially
London eggs, in a low room is not
agreeable.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were talking about the tribes of
Northern Asia—Samojeds, Ostiacks, Tungus,
Vogulese, about brachycephalic and dolichocephalic
heads, and agglutinative tongues,
and linguistic roots; and then one of the
gentlemen dropped some of his egg on his
beard, and continued to eat and talk of
agglutinative tongues, and ethnological
peculiarities, and Turanian characteristics,
without observing it; and the drop of yolk
coagulated on his beard, and moved with his
jaw, and became agitated and excited over
the linguistic affinities of the Tchuchtchees
with the Koriacks on one side and the
Yuckaheres on the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell was teased both by the drop of
yolk from which she could not withdraw her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>eye, and by the vehemence of the disputants,
and by the—to her—uninteresting nature of
the topic that was discussed. She forced
herself to look into the street, and observe the
passers-by; but in another minute fell to
ruminating on the condition of the gentleman’s
beard, to wondering whether he had
yet wiped the egg-drop away, or why his
friend did not point it out to him; and then
her eye mechanically travelled back to the
beard, and the gamboge spot on it. Presently
a stout, shabbily-dressed lady entered
with her two plain daughters, all three with
that grey complexion that makes one think
the heads must be cut out of Jerusalem
artichoke. The mother had puffy cheeks,
and small beady eyes. She talked loudly to
her daughters, loudly enough to be heard by
all in the room, about her distinguished
acquaintances, her butler, and footmen, and
lady’s-maid, and coachman, and carriages, and
gradually subdued the gentlemen who had
been arguing over the ethnology of Northern
Asia, and set them wondering how it was
that this stout party and her daughters had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>come to so small an inn, and were not occupying
a suite in the Hotel Metropole.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell had endured the talk of the
learned men, but the vulgar clack of this
underbred woman was insupportable. She
rose and ascended the stairs to her bedroom,
which was now, fortunately, ready for her.</p>

<p class='c005'>This room did not command the street.
It looked out at the mews, and beyond the mews
at a row of brick houses, seen above the wall
enclosing the back premises. In the mews
yard were some carriages being washed, and
grooms with their braces discharged from
their right shoulders, brushing and combing
their horses. Over the stables were the
windows of the dwellings of the cabdrivers
and their wives, and of the ostlers; and there
were sickly attempts at flower gardening in
some of them. Out of others hung articles
of clothing to be aired or dried. A multitude
of dingy sparrows hopped about in the yard,
and also a considerable and apparently inexhaustible
number of equally dingy children.</p>

<p class='c005'>Beyond the wall of the backyard of a house
in the row was a gaunt Lombardy poplar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>trunk and branches sable as the stalks of
maidenhair fern. What a pretty view had
been that which Arminell had commanded
from her bed-room window at Orleigh! The
sweeps of green turf in the park, the stately
trees, the cedars, and the copper beech, and
the silver birch! How the birds had sung
in the morning about her window! How
sweet had been the incense of the wisteria
trusses of lilac flowers entering at the open
casement!</p>

<p class='c005'>What would her father say at her departure?
Into what a predicament had she put
him? She had forced him into one from
which he could not escape without publishing
his own dishonour, without allowing his wife,
and the parish, and the county, and society
generally to know that once on a time he had
behaved in a manner unworthy of a gentleman
to a poor servant girl. He to whom
every one in the place, in the county, looked
up as a spotless and worthy John Bull, was
to be proclaimed an impostor, and made the
talk of idle and malicious tongues.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If a man has done wrong,” she said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>justify herself, “he must bear the consequences.
It is cowardly to try and hide
the act, evade what it entails, and base to
appear before the world under false pretences.
Let him acknowledge the wrong he has done,
and men will then respect him because he is
open, and does not shrink from those consequences
a wrong act brings on the wrong-doer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But this did not satisfy her. It might be
true, it was true, that this was the only right
and honourable course for one to take who
had erred, but—was she, his daughter, the
proper person to force her father into the
course and out of the road he had elected to
pursue? Was it for her hand to rip up old
wounds, and drag into the light the dark
secrets he strove to bury out of sight? Was
it for her to reveal a stain which disfigured
the whole house? Was it for her to shock
her step-mother, and disturb her trust? To
mar the domestic unity and mutual esteem
which had been so perfect?</p>

<p class='c005'>Lady Lamerton had her weaknesses, but
she had also her strength, and her strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>was the rectitude of her heart, which made
her do her duty with all her power. In
pursuance of this sense of duty, Lady Lamerton
had been unfailingly kind to Arminell.
The girl, looking back, saw this now, and was
stung with self-reproach, because in return for
this treatment she cast the apple of discord
between her father and mother, and broke
what to her ladyship was the most precious
jewel she possessed—her reverence for my
lord.</p>

<p class='c005'>And how—when it pleased Arminell to return
home after all the disturbance she had
caused, the pain and humiliation she had
occasioned—how would she be received again
by those she had wronged and hurt? She
had no doubt upon this point. She knew
that she would be received with open arms,
and without a word of reproach from one or
the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Arminell began to sob, and she saw
no more the ostler curricombing his horse,
nor the woman shaking a table-cloth out of a
window, nor the sparrows quarrelling for the
crumbs, nor the back of a maid seated outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>a house on a window ledge cleaning the glass,
or she saw these things through a watery
film.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was roused by a tap at her door. She
hastily dried her eyes, and stood up, with her
back to the light, that her discomposure
might be unobserved, and called to the person
without to enter.</p>

<p class='c005'>A waiter opened the door and announced
that a gentleman had called, and was below
in a private sitting-room. He extended a
tray, and Miss Inglett took from it a card,
and read, “Mr. James Welsh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will come down directly,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>The waiter bowed and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell tarried for a moment only, to recover
herself, and then descended. She expected
to see Jingles with his uncle, but he
was not in the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“At your service, Miss Inglett. I am the
uncle of Hansel who has run away with
Grethel. You find that you have not come
to the cottage of almond rock, with windows
of barley sugar. You are not, I suppose, interested
in politics?”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“No, or only slightly. Social subjects—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Neither in Monday’s paper. Never in
my life saw one with less of interest in it, no
news, nothing but a Temperance Demonstration
at Exeter Hall, presided over by the
Reverend Jowles. It is not worth your while
looking into a paper to-day.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is Mr. Saltren returned?” asked Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Damped off,” replied Welsh. “That is
a process whereby an amateur loses a good
many cuttings and seedlings. Hansel came
to me with any amount of young hopes and
ambitions and cockscombs—especially, and I
have damped them all off. Expected to make a
fortune in literature, wanted to tread the
walks of political journalism—as well try to
tread the tight rope without previous education.
Miss Inglett, you will see no more of
him. So what is Grethel to do without her
Hansel?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He paused for a minute but received no
answer, not, perhaps, that he expected one,
but he allowed time for what he had said to
soak into her mind before he went on.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“There is a story,” continued Welsh, who
purposely spun out what he had to say,
knowing it was an unpleasant dose, and therefore
to be mixed with jam. “There is a
story by a classic author, whom I have read
only in English, concerning a young man
named Lucius who once saw a woman smear
herself with an unguent, whereupon she flew
out at the window, transformed into a bird.
Lucius got hold of the unguent and applied it
to himself and found himself to have become—not
a bird by any means—simply an ass.
Our good friend has been going through the
same experience. You, Miss Inglett, have
spread your wings, and Giles comes trotting
after with a bray. You need not be afraid—he
will not show himself again. He has
looked on himself in a mirror, and is hiding
his ears.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you mean, Mr. Welsh, that your
nephew has deserted me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The ass is just now so ashamed of himself,
that he is in hiding. But no more about
him. What about yourself? I place myself
unreservedly at your disposal. I will reconduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>you to Orleigh, by the next train, and
telegraph for the carriage to meet us at the
station.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot go back—just now.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you a relation, a lady, in town who
could receive you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lady Hermione Woodhead—my aunt.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then I will take you to her at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot go to her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then Mrs. Welsh will be happy to accommodate
you. She is without a cook, but that
don’t matter. She can make good pastry.
Come along with me to Shepherd’s Bush.
There will be rissoles for dinner to-day as we
had joint yesterday; and we will buy a pair
of soles on our way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I cannot understand,” said Arminell. “I
came here with your nephew. I suppose
you are aware that he is my half-brother.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Half-fiddlesticks,” exclaimed Mr. Welsh.
“My dear young lady, you have been carried
off your feet by romantic fancies, which at a
certain ingenious age inflate the head as carburetted
hydrogen does a goldbeaterskin bag.
Giles has been in the same condition, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>have pricked the bag and let out the nonsense.
Now his head is in a condition of collapse.
That which you were told about his parentage
is all nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you mean—” Arminell did not finish
the sentence, she was interrupted by Welsh.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, I do,” he said. “I know all the
circumstances. I know more about them than
my sister Marianne supposes. Marianne is an
utter liar, has a physical infirmity, I suppose,
which prevents her tongue from being straight.
It describes as many curls as a corkscrew on
the St. Gothard line. She has about as keen
a sense of truth as a Russian diplomatist, and
as much bounce as General Boulanger. Now
then—as you see from which direction the
wind blows, and where lie the reefs, perhaps
you will allow a pilot to come unsignalled on
board, and turn your head off the breakers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have made a mistake—a fatal mistake,”
was all that Arminell could say, dropping her
hands at her sides.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Those are precisely my nephew’s words—literally
the same; which is not to be wondered
at, because you have both fallen together into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the same error. Come, I must help you out
of your difficulties. What will you do? Go
to your aunt? Return home? Or come to
Shepherd’s Bush to rissoles and a pair of soles,
fried or boiled as you prefer?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But where is Mr. Saltren? I ought to see
him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He will not show his face again. He is at
the present moment like blancmange from
which the isinglass has been omitted, in a condition
of mental and moral imbecility.”</p>

<p class='c005'>A tap at the door, and without waiting for
an answer Giles Inglett Saltren entered, erect
with firm step, and a resolute face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>
  <h2 class='c003'><b><span class='large'>CHAPTER XXXVI.</span></b> <br /> <br /> <span class='small'><b>A RALLY.</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Giles Inglett Saltren had left the cab at
Cumberland Gate, when the momentary faintness
had passed. He wished to be alone, in
the fresh air, and with his own thoughts. His
uncle had detained the cab till he saw that his
nephew was better. He left him on a bench
in the park and bade him remain there till
his return from the interview with Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>The young man felt the relief of being
alone. The vibration of the carriage, his
uncle’s voice, his own self-reproach, had,
combined with the shock of the news of his
lordship’s death, brought about the slight fit
of unconsciousness. He was in that overwrought
condition of nervous tension in which
another touch would be insupportable; and
Welsh’s finger was not light, he twanged the
fibres in his nephew’s heart, not as if he were
playing a harp with finger-balls, but as if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>were performing on a zither with his nails.
The air was cool; the bench on which Jingles
was seated had not another occupant. The
great open space in Hyde Park devoted to
political meetings was sparsely peopled at
that time in the morning; he was not likely
to be disturbed, and the rumble of vehicles
along Uxbridge Road and Oxford Street produced
a soothing effect rather than the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c005'>A Frenchman was walking along the path
before his bench with a walking-stick; he
had found a bit of slate in the way, and with
his cane he flipped it along a few feet, then
stopped, and flipped it on to the grass; went
upon the turf and flipped it back into the path.
Then he sent it forward, past Jingles on his
bench, and so on as far as Cumberland Gate,
where the young man lost sight of Monsieur,
and was unable to see whether he continued
to drive the scrap of slate before him up
Oxford Street in the direction of his haunts
in Leicester Square, or whether he left it
under the arch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Till the Frenchman had disappeared, Giles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Saltren did not begin to consider his own
trouble. He could not do so till the bit of
slate was gone beyond his range, with Monsieur
after it. Watching the man was a
sensible relief to him. When one has run, a
pause allows the recovery of breath, and
abates the pulsations, so did this diversion of
attention serve to relieve Jingles, to lull the
agony of remorse, and enable his mind to
regain something of evenness and tone.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a man has been struck on the head
by a hammer, he falls. Jingles had received
three stunning blows, and recovery could not
be immediate. His sanguine hopes of living
by his pen had been upset, and that was a
blow to his self-esteem. Then his belief in
his noble parentage had been knocked over.
And lastly he had heard of Lord Lamerton’s
death—and whether that were accidental or
not, he could hardly doubt that he had brought
it about, for his lordship would not have left
his guests to go to Chillacot, had he not been impelled
to do so by learning of the elopement.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are moments in the lives of most
of us when we come on new scenes that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>are epoch-making in our life’s history. I
shall never forget as such my first view of
Mont Blanc, from the Col de Balme, and of
a portion of the moon’s surface through the
Cambridge Observatory telescope, or the first
sight of death. Some of these first sights are
invested with pleasure unutterable, others
with infinite pain; and of such latter are
often those peeps within ourselves which we
sometimes obtain.</p>

<p class='c005'>What atmospheric effects, what changing
lights, all beautiful, invest the outer landscape
with magic, even where the scenery is tame.
How rarely is it unpleasing to the eye. And
it is the same when we turn our eyes inwards,
and contemplate the landscape of our own
selves, what glories of light flood all, what
richness of foliage clothes all, how picturesque
are the inequalities! How vast the surface
to the horizon! And yet, it sometimes
happens, not often, and not even to all, that a
shadow falls over the scene and blots out all
its comeliness, and then ensues a flare, a
lightning flash, and we see all—no longer
beautiful, but infinitely ghastly.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Saint Theresa, in one of her autobiographical
sketches, says that she was shown
her own self, on one occasion of introspection,
not as she was wont to view it, but as it was
in naked reality, and she could never after
recall the vision without a shudder.</p>

<p class='c005'>Who sees himself as he is? Who wishes
to do so? Who would not be offended were
you to exhibit to his eyes a picture of himself
as he is? No one likes his own photograph,
for the sun does not flatter. But no photographs
have yet been taken of man’s interior
self; if they were, no one would consent to
look on his own; he would spend all his
fortune in buying up the copies and destroying
the plates.</p>

<p class='c005'>We are accustomed to view ourselves as
those do who stand on the Brocken, magnified
a thousand fold, with rainbow haloes
about our heads. I have known a little
fellow, who reached my elbow, strut with infinite
consequence and gesticulate with tragic
dignity on the Brocken, before his own
shadow projected on a cloud, nimbus-girded,
and vast as the All-Father of Norse mythology.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>A breath of wind passed, and the
phantom vanished. But we carry our
Brocken shadow about with us everywhere,
and posture to it, and look up to it with an
awe and admiration that slides into worship;
and very rarely does the cold east wind
sweep it away. But there remains this consolation
to the Brocken shadow worshipper,
that when the phantom form disappears,
<i>nothing</i> remains behind, and it is a satisfaction,
a poor one, but still a satisfaction, when
the blast has dispelled our ideal self before
which we have bowed, to discover behind it
simple nonentity. There would be disenchantment
indeed, and a graver walk, and a
more subdued voice, and a less self-asserting
tone, but there would not be that exquisite,
that annihilating horror that ensues when the
scattering of the vapour discloses a reality
the reverse at every point of what we had
imagined.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Egyptian temples hung purple
curtains embroidered with gold, and censers
perpetually smoked before the veil, and
golden lamps, ever burning, diffused a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>mellow light through the sacred enclosure.
What was behind that pictured spangled veil,
within the holy of holies? Sometimes a hippopotamus
wallowing on straw—or a chattering
crane—sometimes Nothing. We are
engaged all our lives in the erection of magnificent
temples about ourselves, and in
embroidering gold-besprent curtains, and in
the burning of frankincense, and in the
kindling and feeding of lamps, in these
tabernacles; and what is behind the veil?
Do we know? Do we ever look? We
paint and plate with gold ideal representations
of the god within on the propylæum of
our temple, but what resemblance does this
figure bear to the reality? Do we know?
Do we care to know? Will we not rather
put out our eyes than compare them? If, by
chance, a sudden gleam of sun, a puff of pure
air, stir the curtain and reveal the mystery,
with what haste we fly to duplicate the veils,
to blind the windows, to nail the curtains to
the gilded sideposts, and weight them with
lead. How we redouble our prostrations,
and make more dense the cloud of incense;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>how we elaborate our ceremonial, and when
the hippopotamus within yawns, or the ibis
chatters, we clash our symbals, boom our
drums, peal our trumpets to drown the utterance
of the god.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was in Alexandria no god like unto
Serapis, whose temple was the wonder of the
world. But one day an impious hand struck
off the head, and out of the gilded idol rushed
a legion of rats. There is no god, no idol,
like the ideal self within the veil; but it does
not chance to every one as it chanced to
Giles Inglett Saltren, to have its head
knocked off and see the vermin scamper out
of it. When that does happen, that is a
moment never to be forgotten. It is a
moment of infinite importance in the life-history,
it is a moment determinative of the
future. The worshippers of Serapis, after that
terrible spectacle, which was also extremely
laughable, stood in consternation; and at that
moment stood also at the fork of two roads.
Either they shuffled off to the left, with their
hands in their pockets, damning all religion,
and vowing they would believe in nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>thenceforth, or they moved with firm steps
along the right-hand road that led to a truer
faith.</p>

<p class='c005'>The same takes place with us when the
Serapis of our ideal self is broken and reveals
the nest of rats within, Either our moral
nature becomes disintegrated, and breaks
down utterly and irremediably into unsightly
débris, or we turn from the worship of ourselves
to seek elsewhere our ideal, and
looking to it, attain to a nobler, more
generous, an altruistic life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. James Welsh had not spared Jingles;
he had told him plainly, even coarsely, what
he thought of him, but no words of his could
express the intensity of the sense of infamy
that Giles Inglett felt. For a moment he
had been stunned, numbed as hand and foot
become numbed for awhile, and then with a
tingling and needle-pricking, the moral juices
began once more to flow, and the agony of
inner pain he felt was the pledge of moral
recovery.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as Giles Inglett Saltren began to
consider what were the consequences drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>upon him and Arminell by his folly, an
almost overpowering desire came over him
to fly from England. He had sufficient money
to pay his passage across the Atlantic, and
to maintain him in a new world till he could
obtain a suitable situation. In a new world
he might begin life anew, leaving behind his
old follies and faults, and make a smooth
table of the past. In the old world he could
do nothing to remedy what he had wrought;
but he put the temptation from him. He
saw that to yield to it would be an act of
cowardice, and would result in moral ruin.
Instinctively, without self-analysis, he reached
the conclusion that a single course lay open
before him if he were to save his moral self
from wreck. The same moment that he became
conscious of this, he stood up, and
hailed a passing empty hansom.</p>

<p class='c005'>That moment saw the beginning of a new
life in him; new ends, new visions rose before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus it was that Giles Inglett Saltren
entered the sitting-room where his uncle was
engaged with Arminell, and thus it was that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>he entered it a very different man from what
Mr. Welsh had described him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How came you here?” asked the
journalist. “Did not I tell you to remain in
Hyde Park till you were wanted?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have come,” answered Giles firmly,
“to speak to Miss Inglett. I have a just
duty to perform to her, to clear her mind of
the clouds I have brought over it. Miss
Inglett, I was utterly wrong in supposing
that his lordship was—was—what I let you
believe him to be, my father. I did him a
grievous wrong, I imagined it possible that
the best and most blameless of men had been
guilty of the basest conduct. And now that
your father is dead—”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dead!” echoed Arminell.</p>

<p class='c005'>Saltren looked at his uncle. He had
supposed that Welsh had broken the news to
the girl.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said he, and his voice, which before
was firm, gave way for a moment. “Your
father is dead.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Dead!” again repeated Arminell, and
put her hands to her brow. She was being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>stunned by repeated blows, as Saltren had
been stunned. “Dead! Impossible.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Inglett, it is as well that you should
know all, and know it at once, for action
must be taken immediately. Your father
has met with an accident—he has been found
dead after a fall. I shall return immediately
by the express to Orleigh. I go to my
mother at Chillacot. You must allow my
uncle at once to escort you to Lady
Hermione; place yourself under her protection,
and confide to her all the particulars
of your leaving home. I will see Lady
Lamerton, and she shall telegraph to you at
Lady Hermione’s to return to the Park. I
will wire at once, in your name, to your
mother, to send your lady’s-maid to you at
your aunt’s in Portland Place. Your maid
will find you there, and attend you home to
Orleigh. It is possible that by this means
your running away from home with me may
remain unknown. You left Orleigh on
Saturday, by to-night your maid will be with
you in Portland Place, and I shall be seen
this evening at Orleigh, where I shall make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>it a point of showing myself. It is therefore
not likely that suspicions of my ever having
left may arise. There is no time to be lost.
You will hear, all too soon, the particulars of
your father’s death—about myself I will not
speak. I should be ashamed to say a word
in self-justification, and my self-reproach is
beyond the power of words to express.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell turned herself about, as though
rotating on a pivot, holding her temples with
both hands, and elbows extended.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Mr. Welsh, “this is well considered.
Giles, it shall be as you say. I
will take Miss Inglett at once to Portland
Place, unless she prefers that I should go
to her ladyship, and prepare her; and then
Miss Inglett can follow. That probably will
be the least painful course.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Arminell still swung herself from side to
side. She was pale as ashes, and her eyes
full of trouble and terror.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will go home directly, uncle,” said
Giles. “I have acted not like a fool only,
but wickedly, and I must face the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Arminell remained stationary, and released
her temples.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What was that you said?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I have been guilty, not of indiscretion
only, but of a crime,” said he, gravely,
“I must face the consequences, be they what
they may.” Then Arminell drew a long breath.
She recovered her composure for a moment.
She recalled what had been her judgment
on her father when she thought him guilty.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I also,” she said, and her voice was
harsh, “I also have been guilty, not of folly
only, but of a crime. I have sinned against
my dear, dear father. I will not go to my
Aunt Hermione. I will not go back to
Orleigh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But the repentant prodigal,” said Welsh,
“in the Gospel story did return.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“When the father was at home to receive
him,” answered Arminell, sharply. “There
is not—” She drew another long breath;
and then said, “I also will face the consequences.”</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
